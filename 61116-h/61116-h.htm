  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Before there was civilization in Egypt, or the
delta of the Nile had been formed, the whole
country as far south as modern Cairo lay under
the sea. The shores of this sea were a limestone
desert. The coast line was smooth usually, but at
the north-west corner a remarkable spur jutted out
from the main mass. It was less than a mile wide,
but thirty miles long. Its base is not far from
Bahig, Alexandria is built half-way down it, its tip
is the headland of Aboukir. On either side of it
there was once deep salt water.</p>
<p class='c005'>Centuries passed, and the Nile, issuing out of
its crack above Cairo, kept carrying down the muds
of Upper Egypt and dropping them as soon as its
current slackened. In the north-west corner they
were arrested by this spur and began to silt up
against it. It was a shelter not only from the outer
sea, but from the prevalent wind. Alluvial land
appeared; the large shallow lake of Mariout was
formed; and the current of the Nile, unable to
escape through the limestone barrier, rounded the
headland of Aboukir and entered the outer sea
by what was known in historical times as the
“Canopic” mouth.</p>

<p class='c005'>To the north of the spur and more or less
parallel to it runs a second range of limestone.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>It is much shorter, also much lower, lying mainly
below the surface of the sea in the form of reefs,
but without it there would have been no harbours
(and consequently no Alexandria), because it breaks
the force of the waves. Starting at Agame, it
continues as a series of rocks across the entrance
of the modern harbour. Then it re-emerges to
form the promontory of Ras el Tin, disappears into
a second series of rocks that close the entrance of
the Eastern Harbour, and makes its final appearance
as the promontory of Silsileh, after which it rejoins
the big spur.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such is the scene where the following actions
and meditations take place; that limestone ridge,
with alluvial country on one side of it and harbours
on the other, jutting from the desert, pointing
towards the Nile; a scene unique in Egypt, nor
have the Alexandrians ever been truly Egyptian.
Here Africans, Greeks and Jews combined to make
a city; here a thousand years later the Arabs set
faintly but durably the impress of the Orient; here
after secular decay rose another city, still visible,
where I worked or appeared to work during a
recent war. Pharos, the vast and heroic lighthouse
that dominated the first city—under Pharos I have
grouped a few antique events; to modern events
and to personal impressions I have given the name
of Pharillon, the obscure successor of Pharos, which
clung for a time to the low rock of Silsileh and
then slid unobserved into the Mediterranean.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c003'>I</h3>
<p class='c011'>The career of Menelaus was a series of small
mishaps. It was after he had lost Helen, and
indeed after he had recovered her and was returning
from Troy, that a breeze arose from the north-west
and obliged him to take refuge upon a desert
island. It was of limestone, close to the African
coast, and to the estuary though not to the exit
of the Nile, and it was protected from the Mediterranean
by an outer barrier of reefs. Here he
remained for twenty days, in no danger, but in
high discomfort, for the accommodation was
insufficient for the Queen. Helen had been to
Egypt ten years before, under the larger guidance
of Paris, and she could not but remark that there
was nothing to see upon the island and nothing
to eat and that its beaches were infested with seals.
Action must be taken, Menelaus decided. He
sought the sky and sea, and chancing at last to
apprehend an old man he addressed to him the
following wingèd word:</p>
<p class='c005'>“What island is this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pharaoh’s,” the old man replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pharos?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Pharaoh’s, Prouti’s”—Prouti being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>another title (it occurs in the hieroglyphs) for the
Egyptian king.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Proteus?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as Menelaus had got everything wrong,
the wind changed and he returned to Greece with
news of an island named Pharos whose old man
was called Proteus and whose beaches were infested
with nymphs. Under such misapprehensions did
it enter our geography.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pharos was hammer-headed, and long before
Menelaus landed some unknown power—Cretan—Atlantean—had
fastened a harbour against its
western promontory. To the golden-haired king,
as to us, the works of that harbour showed only
as ochreous patches and lines beneath the dancing
waves, for the island has always been sinking, and
the quays, jetties, and double breakwater of its pre-historic
port can only be touched by the swimmer
now. Already was their existence forgotten, and
it was on the other promontory—the eastern—that
the sun of history arose, never to set. Alexander
the Great came here. Philhellene, he proposed to
build a Greek city upon Pharos. But the ridge of
an island proved too narrow a site for his ambition,
and the new city was finally built upon the opposing
coast—Alexandria. Pharos, tethered to Alexandria
by a long causeway, became part of a larger scheme
and only once re-entered Alexander’s mind: he
thought of it at the death of Hephæstion, as he
thought of all holy or delectable spots, and he
arranged that upon its distant shore a shrine should
commemorate his friend, and reverberate the grief
that had convulsed Ecbatana and Babylon.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Meanwhile the Jews had been attentive. They,
too, liked delectable spots. Deeply as they were
devoted to Jehovah, they had ever felt it their
duty to leave his city when they could, and as soon
as Alexandria began to develop they descended
upon her markets with polite cries. They found
so much to do that they decided against returning
to Jerusalem, and met so many Greeks that they
forgot how to speak Hebrew. They speculated
in theology and grain, they lent money to Ptolemy
the second king, and filled him (they tell us) with
such enthusiasm for their religion that he commanded
them to translate their Scriptures for their
own benefit. He himself selected the translators,
and assigned for their labours the island of Pharos
because it was less noisy than the mainland. Here
he shut up seventy rabbis in seventy huts, whence
in an incredibly short time they emerged with
seventy identical translations of the Bible. Everything
corresponded. Even when they slipped they
made seventy slips, and Greek literature was at last
enriched by the possession of an inspired book. It
was left to later generations to pry into Jehovah’s
scholarship and to deduce that the Septuagint
translation must have extended over a long period
and not have reached completion till 100 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
The Jews of Alexandria knew no such doubts.
Every year they made holiday on Pharos in remembrance
of the miracle, and built little booths along
the beaches where Helen had once shuddered at
the seals. The island became a second Sinai whose
moderate thunders thrilled the philosophic world.
A translation, even when it is the work of God,
is never as intimidating as an original; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>unknown author of the “Wisdom of Solomon”
shows, in his delicious but dubious numbers, how
unalarming even an original could be when it was
composed at Alexandria:</p>

<p class='c012'>Let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily
use the creatures like as in youth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments, and let no
flower of the spring pass by us.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us crown ourselves with rose-buds before they are withered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let none of us go without his part in our voluptuousness, let us
leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place, for this is our portion
and our lot is this.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is true that, pulling himself together, the
writer goes on to remind us that the above remarks
are no elegy on Alexander and Hephæstion, but
an indictment of the ungodly, and must be read
sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such things they did imagine and were deceived, for their own
wickedness hath blinded them.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for the mysteries of God they knew them not, neither hoped
they for the wages of righteousness nor discerned a reward for
blameless souls.</p>

<p class='c013'>For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be the
image of his own eternity.</p>

<p class='c014'>But it is too late. And all racial and religious
effort was too late. Though Pharos was not to
be Greek it was not to be Hebrew either. A more
impartial power dominated it. Five hundred feet
above all shrines and huts, Science had already
raised her throne.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>II</h3>

<p class='c014'>A lighthouse was a necessity. The coast of
Egypt is, in its western section, both flat and rocky,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and ships needed a landmark to show them where
Alexandria lay, and a guide through the reefs that
block her harbours. Pharos was the obvious site,
because it stood in front of the city; and on Pharos
the eastern promontory, because it commanded the
more important of the two harbours—the Royal.
But it is not clear whether a divine madness also
seized the builders, whether they deliberately
winged engineering with poetry, and tried to add a
wonder to the world. At all events they succeeded,
and the arts combined with science to praise their
triumph. Just as the Parthenon had been identified
with Athens, and St. Peter’s was to be identified
with Rome, so, to the imagination of contemporaries,
“The Pharos” became Alexandria and Alexandria
the Pharos. Never, in the history of architecture,
has a secular building been thus worshipped and
taken on a spiritual life of its own. It beaconed
to the imagination, not only to ships, and long
after its light was extinguished memories of it
glowed in the minds of men. Perhaps it was
merely very large; reconstructions strike a chill,
and the minaret, its modern descendant, is not
supremely beautiful. Something very large to
which people got used—a Liberty Statue, an Eiffel
Tower? The possibility must be faced, and is not
excluded by the ecstasies of the poets.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lighthouse was made of local limestone, of
marble, and of reddish-purple granite from Assouan.
It stood in a colonnaded court that covered most
of the promontory. There were four stories.
The bottom story was over two hundred feet high,
square, pierced with many windows. In it were
the rooms (estimated at three hundred) where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>mechanics and keepers were housed, and its mass
was threaded by a spiral ascent, probably by a
double spiral. There may have been hydraulic
machinery in the central well for raising the fuel
to the top; otherwise we must imagine a procession
of donkeys who cease not night and day to
circumambulate the spirals with loads of wood
upon their backs. The story ended in a cornice
and in statues of Tritons: here too, in great letters
of lead, was a Greek inscription mentioning the
architect: “Sostratus of Cnidus, son of Dexiphanes,
to the Saviour Gods: for sailors”—an inscription
which, despite its simplicity, bore a double meaning.
The Saviour Gods were the Dioscuri, but a courtly
observer could refer them to Ptolemy Soter and his
wife, whose worship their son was then promoting.
For the building of the lighthouse (279 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) was
connected with an elaborate dynastic propaganda
known as the “As-good-as-Olympic Games,” and
with a mammoth pageant which passed through
the streets of Alexandria, regardless of imagination
and expense. Nothing could be seen in the
pageant, neither elephants nor camels nor dances
of wild men, nor allegorical females upon a car,
nor eggs that opened and disclosed the Dioscuri;
and the inscription on the first story of the Pharos
was a subtle echo of its appeal.</p>

<p class='c005'>The second story was octagonal and entirely
filled by the ascending spirals. The third story was
circular. Then came the lantern. The lantern is
a puzzle, because a bonfire and delicate scientific
instruments appear to have shared its narrow
area. Visitors speak, for instance, of a mysterious
“mirror” up there, which was even more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>wonderful than the building itself. Why didn’t this
mirror crack, and what was it? A polished steel
reflector for the fire at night or for heliography by
day? Some writers describe it as made of finely
wrought glass or transparent stone, and declare
that when they sat under it they could see ships
at sea that were invisible to the naked eye. A
telescope? Is it conceivable that the Alexandrian
school of mathematics and mechanics discovered
the lens and that their discovery was lost and
forgotten when the Pharos fell? It is possible:
the discoveries of Aristarchus were forgotten, and
Galileo persecuted for reviving them. It is certain
that the lighthouse was equipped with every
scientific improvement known to the age, that it
was the outward expression of the studies pursued
in the Museum across the straits, and that its
architect could have consulted not only Aristarchus,
but Eratosthenes, Apollonius of Perga,
and Euclid.</p>

<p class='c005'>Standing on the lantern, at the height of five
hundred feet above the ground, a statue of Poseidon
struck the pious note, and gave a Greek air to
Africa seen from the sea. Other works of art are
also reported: for example, a statue whose finger
followed the diurnal course of the sun, a second
statue who gave out with varying and melodious
voices the various hours of the day, and a third
who shouted an alarm as soon as a hostile flotilla
set sail from any foreign port. This last must
belong to an even more remarkable building, the
Pharos of legend, which we will measure in a
moment. The lighthouse was the key of the
Alexandrian defences, and Cæsar occupied it before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>attacking the city. It was also the pivot of a
signalling system that stretched along the coast.
Fifteen miles to the west, on a ridge among masses
of marigolds, the little watch-tower of Abousir is
still standing, and it reproduces, in its three stories,
the arrangements of Sostratus.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>III</h3>

<p class='c014'>“I have taken a city,” wrote the Arab conqueror
of Alexandria, “of which I can only say that it
contains 4000 palaces, 4000 baths, 400 theatres,
12,000 greengrocers, and 40,000 Jews.” It contained
a lighthouse, too, for the Pharos was still
perfect and functioned for a few years more,
lighting the retreating fleets of Europe with its
beams. Then a slow dissolution began, and it
shrinks, looms through the mists of legend, disappears.
The first, and the irreparable, disaster
was the fall of the lantern in the eighth century,
carrying with it scientific apparatus that could not
be replaced. Annoyed (say the Arabs) with the
magic mirror that detected or scorched their ships,
the Christians made a plot, and sent a messenger
to Islam with news of a treasure in Syria. The
treasure was found, whereupon the messenger
reported something supreme—the whole wealth of
Alexander and other Pharaohs which lay in the
foundations of the lighthouse. Demolition began,
and before the Alexandrians, who knew better,
could intervene, the mirror had fallen and was
smashed on the rocks beneath. Henceforward the
Pharos is only a stump with a bonfire on the top.
The Arabs made some restorations, but they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>unsubstantial additions to the octagon, which the
wind could blow away. Structural repairs were
neglected, and in the twelfth century the second
disaster occurred—the fall of the octagon through
an earthquake. The square bottom story survived
as a watch-tower. Two hundred years later it
vanished in a final earthquake, and the very island
where it had stood modified its shape and became
a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a strip of
sand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Though unable to maintain the lighthouse on
earth, the Arabs did much for it in the realms of
fancy, increasing its height to seven hundred feet,
and endowing it with various magical objects, of
which the most remarkable was a glass crab. There
really were crabs at Alexandria, but of copper,
quite small, and standing under Cleopatra’s Needle;
America possesses one to-day. Oriental imagination
mixed two monuments into one, and caused
a Moorish army to invade the Pharos and to ride
through its three hundred rooms. The entrance
gate vanished, and they could not find their way
out, but ever descending the spirals came at last
to the glass crab, slipped through a crack in its
back and were drowned. Happier, though equally
obscure, was the fate of another visitor, the poet
El Deraoui. Who sings:</p>

<p class='c012'>A lofty platform guides the voyager by night, guides him with
its light when the darkness of evening falls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thither have I borne a garment of perfect pleasure among my
friends, a garment adorned with the memory of beloved companions.</p>

<p class='c013'>On its height a dome enshadowed me, and there I saw my
friends like stars.</p>

<p class='c013'>I thought that the sea below me was a cloud, and that I had
set up my tent in the midst of the heavens.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Only occasionally does the note of disillusionment
and bitterness creep in. Jelaled Din ibn
Mokram complains that:</p>

<p class='c012'>The visitor to Alexandria receives nothing in the way of hospitality
except some water and a description of Pompey’s Pillar.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those who make a special effort sometimes give him a little
fresh air too, and tell him where the Pharos is, adding a sketch of
the sea and its waves and an account of the large Greek ships.</p>

<p class='c013'>The visitor need not aspire to receive any bread, for to an
application of this type there is no reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a rule, life in its shadow is an earthly ecstasy
that may even touch heaven. Hark to Ibn Dukmak:</p>

<p class='c012'>According to the law of Moses, if a man make a pilgrimage
round Alexandria in the morning, God will make for him a golden
crown set with pearls, perfumed with musk and camphor and
shining from the east to the west.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor were the Arabs content with praising the
lighthouse: they even looked at it. “El Manarah,”
as they called it, gave the name to, and became the
model for, the minaret, and one can still find minarets
in Egypt that exactly reproduce the design
of Sostratus—the bottom story square, second
octagonal, third round.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Fort of Kait Bey, built in the fifteenth
century and itself now a ruin, stands to-day where
the Pharos once stood. Its area covers part of the
ancient enclosure—the rest is awash with the sea—and
in its containing wall are embedded a few
granite columns. Inside the area is a mosque,
exactly occupying the site of the lighthouse, and
built upon its foundations: here, too, are some
granite blocks standing with druidical effect at the
mosque’s entrance. Nothing else can be attributed
to the past, its stones have vanished and its spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>also. Again and again, looking at the mosque,
have I tried to multiply its height by five, and thus
build up its predecessor. The effort always failed:
it did not seem reasonable that so large an edifice
should have existed. The dominant memory in
the chaos is now British, for here are some large
holes, made by Admiral Seymour when he bombarded
the Fort in 1882 and laid the basis of our
intercourse with modern Egypt.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE RETURN FROM SIWA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Alexander the Great founded Alexandria. He
came with Dinocrates, his architect, and ordered
him to build, between the sea and the lake, a
magnificent Greek town. Alexander still conceived
of civilization as an extended Greece, and
of himself as a Hellene. He had taken over
Hellenism with the ardour that only a proselyte
knows. A Balkan barbarian by birth, he had
pushed himself into the enchanted but enfeebled
circle of little city states. He had flattered Athens
and spared Thebes, and preached a crusade against
Persia, which should repeat upon a vaster scale
the victories of Marathon and Salamis. He would
even repeat the Trojan war. At the Dardanelles
his archæological zeal was such that he ran naked
round the tomb of Achilles. He cut the knot of
Gordius. He appeased the soul of Priam.</p>
<p class='c005'>Having annexed Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine,
and Egypt from the Persians, and having given
his orders to Dinocrates, he left the city he was
building, and rode with a few friends into the
western desert. It was summer. The waters of
Lake Mariout, more copious then than now, spread
fertility for a space. Leaving their zone, he struck
south, over the limestone hills, and lost sight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>civilization whether of the Hellenic or non-Hellenic
type. Around him little flat pebbles shimmered
and danced in the heat, gazelles stared, and pieces
of sky slopped into the sand. Over him was the
pale blue dome of heaven, darkened, if we are to
believe his historian, by flocks of obsequious birds,
who sheltered the King with their shadows and
screamed when he rode the wrong way. Alexander
went on till he saw below him, in the fall of the
ground, the canals and hot springs and olives and
palms of the Oasis of Siwa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sekhet-Amit the Egyptians called it, and worshipped
their god Amen there, whom the Greeks
call Ammon, worshipped him in the form of an
emerald that lay in a sacred boat, worshipped him
as a ram also. Instead of the twin mud-cities of
Siwa and Aghurmi, Alexander saw pylons and
colonnades, and descending into the steamy heat
of the Oasis approached a lonely and mysterious
shrine. For what was it mysterious? Perhaps
merely for its loneliness. The distance, the solitude
of the desert, touch travellers even to-day, and
sharpen the imaginations of men who have crossed
in armoured cars, and whom no god awaits, only
a tract of green. Alexander rode, remembering
how, two hundred years before him, the Persians
had ridden to loot the temple, and how on them
as they were eating in the desert a sandstorm had
descended, burying diners and dinner in company.
Herein lay the magic of Siwa. It was difficult to
reach. He, being the greatest man of his epoch,
had of course succeeded. He, the Philhellene,
had come. His age was twenty-five. Then took
place that celebrated and extraordinary episode.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>According to the official account the Priest came out
of the temple and saluted the young tourist as Son
of God. Alexander acquiesced and asked whether
he would become King of this World. The reply
was in the affirmative. Then his friends asked
whether they should worship him. They were
told that they should, and the episode closed. Some
say that it is to be explained by the Priest’s bad
Greek. He meant to say Paidion (“my child”)
and said Paidios (“O Son of God”) instead. Others
say that it never took place, and Walter Savage
Landor has imagined a conversation in the course
of which the Priest scares the King by a snake.
A scare he did get—a fright, a psychic experience,
a vision, a “turn.” His development proves it.
After his return from Siwa his aspirations alter.
Never again does he regard Greece as the centre
of the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>The building of Alexandria proceeded, and
copied or magnified forms from the perishing
peninsula overseas. Dinocrates planned Greek
temples and market-places, and they were constructed
not slavishly but with intelligence, for the
Greek spirit still lived. But it lived consciously,
not unconsciously as in the past. It had a mission,
and no missionary shall ever create. And Alexander,
the heroic chaos of whose heart surged with desire
for all that can and can not be, turned away from
his Hellenic town-planning and his narrow little
antiquarian crusade, and flung himself again, but
in a new spirit, against the might of Persia. He
fought her as a lover now. He wanted not to
convert but to harmonize, and conceived himself
as the divine and impartial ruler beneath whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>harmony shall proceed. That way lies madness.
Persia fell. Then it was the turn of India. Then
the turn of Rome would have come and then he
could have sailed westward (such was his expressed
intention) until he had conquered the Night and
eastward until he had conquered the Day. He was
never—despite the tuition of Aristotle—a balanced
young man, and his old friends complained that in
this latter period he sometimes killed them. But
to us, who cannot have the perilous honour of his
acquaintance, he grows more lovable now than
before. He has caught, by the unintellectual way,
a glimpse of something great, if dangerous, and
that glimpse came to him first in the recesses of
the Siwan Oasis. When at the age of thirty-three
he died, when the expedition that he did not seek
stole towards him in the summer-house at Babylon,
did it seem to him as after all but the crown of his
smaller quests? He had tried to lead Greece, then
he had tried to lead mankind. He had succeeded
in both. But was the universe also friendly, was it
also in trouble, was it calling on him, on him, for
his help and his love? The priest of Amen had
addressed him as “Son of God.” What exactly
did the compliment mean? Was it explicable this
side of the grave?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>EPIPHANY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>During the last years of their lives the old King
and Queen had seldom left the Palace. They
sought seclusion, though for different reasons.
The King, who was gay and shy, did not wish
his pleasures to be observed. He had gathered a
suitable circle of friends round him, and was content.
There was Agathocles—who, by the way,
was Prime Minister; there was Agathoclea—who,
by the way, was the little prince’s nurse; there was
Œnanthe, the mother of the two A.’s, an elderly
but accomplished woman who knew how to
shampoo. And there were one or two more, for
instance the wife of a forage contractor who would
say to the King, “Here, Daddy, drink this.” The
King liked young women who called him Daddy;
and he drank, and when he had drunk enough he
would get up and dance, the others danced too,
he would fall down, it was all delightful. But it
was not a delight he desired his subjects to witness.</p>
<p class='c005'>The Queen employed herself otherwise. Shut
up in her own apartments, she meditated on the
past. She thought of all the years when she had
been on trial: the King had never cared for her,
and, though negotiating for the marriage, had kept
her waiting. Then came the Battle of Rafa. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Syrians were invading Egypt, and just as the
Egyptian army was breaking she had ridden forth
among the elephants, her hair streaming, her colour
high, and had turned defeat into victory. She
became the popular heroine, and he married her.
But for nine years they had had no child. She
could see no hope anywhere. The child had
come, but the situation had not changed. Months
passed, and still she sat in the Palace enclosure—the
Fortress inside the fortress of the Royal City—and
looked from the promontory that we now
call Silsileh across the harbour to Pharos, and over
the unvarying expanse of the sea.</p>

<p class='c005'>Change came at last. One night, when the King
fell down, he failed to get up again. Agathoclea
paid him every attention, but he passed into a
stupor and died in her arms. His friends were in
despair. He had been such a jolly old King.
And besides, what were they to do? The Queen,
on the other hand, came forward in an unexpected
light. There was no occasion for anxiety, she told
them. She knew what to do quite well. She was
now Regent, and her first act was to dismiss the
ministry. Moreover, since he was now four years
old, her son no longer required a nurse. The old
heroic feelings came back to her. Life seemed
worth living again; She returned to her apartments
full of exaltation. She entered them. As
she did so, the curtains, which had been soaked
with inflammable oil in her absence, burst into
flame. She tried to retire. The doors had been
locked behind her, and she was burnt to death.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the life of Alexandria went on as before.
Œnanthe and her progeny still drove about in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>state carriages. The King and Queen still failed
to appear in public, and the Palace still rose inviolate
inside the walls of the Royal City. Months passed,
fourteen months.</p>

<p class='c005'>When rumours began, the A.’s neglected to act.
Inertia had served them so well that they did not
know how to relinquish it. But rumours continued,
and after many consultations they devised
a pageant that had the feeblest effect. It was not
true, they said, that the old King and Queen had
died a year ago. But it was true that they were
dead. They had died that very minute. Alas!
Woe, oh woe! Here were their urns. Their little
son was now King. Here he was. Agathocles
had been appointed Regent. Here was the will.
Agathoclea—here she was—would continue to be
nurse. The people, sceptical and sullen, watched
the display, which took place in a high gallery of
the Palace, overhanging the town. The actors
made their bow, and gathering up the exhibits
retired. All went on as usual for a little longer.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the misgovernment of Agathocles that
brought things to a crisis: that, and the report
that of the two urns only one contained human
remains: the other, which was supposed to hold
the Queen, was a dummy. Perhaps the little boy
would vanish next. They must see him, touch
him. And they stormed the Palace. It was in
vain that the Regent parleyed, threatened, or that
Agathoclea repeated that she was the royal nurse.
The soldiers joined the people, and they broke
gate after gate. At last the Regent cried, “Take
him!” and, flinging their King at them, fled. The
child was already in tears. They put him on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>horse, and led it outside to the racecourse, where
were assembled more human beings than he had
ever dreamt of, who shouted Epiphany! Epiphany!
and pulled him off the horse and made him sit on
a large seat. This was the world and he did not
like it. He preferred his own little circle. Someone
cried, “Shall we not punish your mother’s
murderers?” He sobbed, “Oh yes—oh anything,”
and it was so. The Regent and his sister had
hidden in the Palace. Œnanthe had driven two
miles away to the Thesmophorion, a sanctuary
near the present Nouzha Gardens. All were
dragged from their retreats, tortured, and killed,
the women being stripped naked first.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such were the circumstances of the accession of
Ptolemy V., surnamed Epiphanes, 204 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PHILO’S LITTLE TRIP</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It was nearly a serious tumble—more serious than
he anticipated. There were six in his party, all
Hebrew gentlemen of position and intelligence,
such as may be seen in these days filling a first-class
carriage in the Cairo express on their way up to
interview the Government. In those days the
Government was not at Cairo but at Rome, and the
six gentlemen were on their way to interview the
Emperor Caligula. Observe them in their well-appointed
little yacht, slipping out of the Mohammed
Ali Square, which was then under water and part
of the Eastern Harbour. Their faces are pale,
partly from fasting, partly from anticipation, for
the passage can be rough in February. And their
mission was even more poignant than cotton. It
concerned their faith. Jews at Alexandria had been
killed and teased, and some Gentiles had, with the
connivance of the Governor, erected a bronze
chariot in their principal synagogue—not even a
new chariot, for the horses had no tails or feet.
It was a chariot once dedicated to—O Pollution!—Cleopatra.
There it stood, and the Jews did
not like to throw it down. And into their smaller
synagogues, smaller objects, such as portraits of the
Emperor, had been thrust. It is a delicate matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to complain to an Emperor about his own portrait,
but Caligula was known to be a charming and
reasonable young man, and the deputation had
been selected for its tact.</p>
<p class='c005'>As they crossed the harbour, the Temple of
Cæsar stood out on the right, so impressive, so
brilliant, that Philo could not repress his enthusiasm
and recalled the view in after years.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a piece incomparably above all others (he writes). It
stands by a most commodious harbour, wonderfully high and large
in proportion; an eminent sea mark: full of choice paintings and
statues with donatives and oblatives in abundance; and then it is
beautiful all over with gold and silver: the model curious and
regular in the disposition of the parts, as galleries, libraries, porches,
courts, halls, walks, and consecrated groves, as glorious as expense
and art could make them, and everything in its proper place;
besides that, the hope and comfort of seafaring men, either coming
in or going out.</p>

<p class='c014'>When would he see this temple as he came in?
Although Cleopatra had begun it for Antony, and
Augustus finished it for himself, it filled him with
love, and he turned from it with reluctance to the
coast on the left, really more important, because
Jehovah had translated the entire Bible into Greek
there. There stood those seventy huts! O wonder!
It was one of the anecdotes with which he hoped
to rivet the attention of Caligula, when they arrived
at Rome.</p>

<p class='c005'>That charming and reasonable young man had
lately recovered from a severe illness, at which the
whole civilized world rejoiced, and the Eternal City
was full of embassies waiting to congratulate him.
Among these, ominously enough, was a counter-deputation
from Alexandria, strongly anti-Semite
in tone. Philo watched it narrowly. The imperial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>invalid did not arrive till August, and at first
things went pleasantly enough. He caught sight
of the Jews one day as he was calling on his mother,
seemed transported with delight and waved his
hand to them, also sent a message that he would
see them at once, but immediately left for Naples,
and they had to follow him thither.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was somewhere between Naples and Baiæ
that the little trip came to its end. We cannot say
where exactly, for the reason that the Emperor
received the deputation over a considerable space
of ground. He was continually on the trot throughout
the audience, and they had to trot after him.
He passed from room to room and from villa to
villa, all of which, he told them, he had thrown
open for their pleasure. They thanked him and
tried to say more. He trotted on. With him ran the
counter-deputation, and also a mob of concierges,
housekeepers, glaziers, plumbers, upholsterers and
decorators, to whom he kept flinging orders. At last
he stopped. The Jews of Alexandria approached.
And with a voice of thunder he cried, “So you
are the criminals who say I am not a god.” It
was shattering, it was appalling, it was the very
point they had hoped would not be raised. For
they worshipped Jehovah only. The counter-deputation
shouted with delight, and the six
Hebrew gentlemen cried in unison, “Caligula!
Caligula! do not be angry with us. We have
sacrificed for you not once but three times—first
at your accession, secondly when you were ill,
thirdly when——” But the Emperor interrupted
them with merciless logic. “Exactly. For me
and not to me,” and dashed off to inspect the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>ladies’ apartments. After him they ran, hopeless
of removing Cleopatra’s chariot or of interesting
him in the Septuagint. They would be lucky if
they secured their lives. He climbed up to look
at a ceiling. They climbed too. He ran along a
plank; so did the Jews. They did not speak, partly
from lack of breath, partly because they were afraid
of his reply. At last, turning in their faces, he
asked, “Why don’t you eat pork?” The counter-deputation
shouted again. The Jews replied that
different races ate different things, and one of them,
to carry off the situation, said some people didn’t
eat lamb. “Of course they don’t,” said the
Emperor, “lamb is beastly.” The situation grew
worse. A fit of fury had seized Caligula at the
thought of lamb and he yelled, “What are your
laws? I wish to know what your laws are!”
They began to tell him and he cried out, “Shut
those windows,” and ran away down a corridor.
Then he turned with extraordinary gentleness and
said, “I beg your pardon, what were you saying?”
They began to tell him of their laws, and he said,
“We’ll have all the old pictures hung together
here, I think.” Stopping anew, he looked round
at his shattered train of ambassadors and artisans,
and smiling, remarked, “And these are the people
who think I am not a god. I don’t blame them.
I merely pity them. They can go.” Philo led
his party back to Alexandria, there to meditate on
the accident that had so spoilt their little trip:
Caligula was mad.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet did it signify—signify in the long run?
The history of the Chosen People is full of such
contretemps, but they survive and thrive. Six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>hundred years later, when Amr took the city, he
found 40,000 Jews there. And look at them in
the railway carriage now. Their faces are anxious
and eloquent of past rebuffs. But they are travelling

  <h2 class='c006'>CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>When the assertions that were made at one time
and another in the uplands of Palestine descended
from their home, and, taking the ancient caravan
route, crossed the River of Egypt and approached
Alexandria, they entered into a new spiritual
atmosphere where they were obliged to transform
themselves or to perish. The atmosphere was not
hostile to the assertions, indeed it welcomed them,
but it insisted that, however unphilosophic they
might be, they should wear the philosophic dress,
that they should take some account of the assertions
that had arrived previously, should recognize the
existence of libraries and museums, should approach
with circumspection the souls of the rich. Under
these conditions they might remain. And exactly
the same thing happened on two distinct occasions.
We are here concerned with the second of the
occasions, but it is convenient to glance at the
first; it was soon after Alexandria had been
founded, and Jews were flocking to her markets.
An unexpected problem confronted them. Jehovah
had said, “I Am that I Am,” and so long as they
remained in Palestine this seemed enough. But
now they had to face disquieting comments, such
as “This statement predicates existence merely,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>or “This statement, while professing merely to
predicate existence, assumes the attribute of speech,”
and they grew aware of the inaccessibility and
illogicality of their national God. The result was
a series of attempts on their part to explain and
recommend Jehovah to the Greeks—culminating
in the great system of Philo, who, by the doctrine
of the Mediating Logos, ensured that the deity
should be at the same time accessible and inaccessible:
“The Logos,” he writes, “dwells on the
margin between the Created and the Increate, and
delights to serve them both.” And there, for a
little, the matter rested.</p>
<p class='c005'>But in Philo’s own lifetime a second assertion
had been made among the Judæan hills. We do
not know its original form—too many minds have
worked over it since—but we know that it was
unphilosophic and anti-social. For it was addressed
to the uneducated and it promised them a kingdom.
Following the usual route, it reached Alexandria,
where the same fate overtook it: it had to face
comments, and in so doing was transformed. It
too evolved a system which, though not logical,
paid the lip service to logic that a great city demands,
and interspersed bridges of argument among the
flights of faith. All Greek thinkers, except Socrates,
had done the same, so that, on its intellectual side,
the new religion did not break with the past; it
consisted of an assertion in a philosophic dress,
and Clement of Alexandria, its first theologian, used
methods that were familiar to Philo two hundred
years before. Not only did he bring allegory to
bear upon the more intractable passages of Scripture,
but he adapted the Philonian Logos and identified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>it with the Founder of the new religion. “In
the beginning was the Word and the Word was
with God.” Philo might have written this. St.
John had added to it two statements distinctly
Christian, namely, “The Word was God” and
“The Word was made flesh.” And now Clement,
taking over the completed conception, raised upon
it a storied fabric such as the Alexandrians loved,
and ensured that the deity should be at the same
time accessible and inaccessible, merciful and just,
human and divine. The fabric would have
bewildered the fishermen of Galilee, and it had
in it a flaw which became evident in the fourth
century and produced the Arian schism. But it
impressed the passing age; Clement, working in
and through Alexandria, did more than even St.
Paul to recommend Christianity to the Gentiles.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was probably born in Greece about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 150
and initiated into Mysteries there. Then he was
converted and became head of the theological
college in Alexandria, where he remained until his
exile in 202. But little is known of his life and
nothing of his character, though one may assume
it was conciliatory: Christianity was not yet
official, and thus in no position to fulminate. Of
his treatises the “Exhortation to the Greeks”
acknowledges several merits in pagan thought,
while “The Rich Man’s Salvation” handles with
delicacy a problem on which business men are
naturally sensitive, and arrives at the comforting
conclusion that Christ did not mean what He said.
One recognizes the wary resident. And when he
attacks Paganism he seldom denounces: he mocks,
knowing this to be the better way. For the age
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>is literal. It had lost resilience and spring, and if
one pointed out to it that Zeus had behaved
absurdly in Homer, it could summon no rush of
instinct or of poetry with which to defend his
worship. Demeter too! And shrines to the
sneezing Apollo and to the gouty and to the
coughing Artemis! Ha! Ha! Fancy believing
in a goddess with the gout. Clement makes great
play with such nonsense. For a new religion has,
as far as persiflage is concerned, an advantage over
an old one: it has not had time itself to evolve a
mythology, and his adversaries could not retort
with references to St. Simeon Stylites, or to the
plague spot of St. Roch, or to St. Fina who allowed
a devil to throw her mother down the stairs.
They could only hang their heads and assent, and
when Clement derided the priests in the idol-temples
for their dirt, they could not foresee that
in the following century dirt would be recommended
as holy by the Church. They were caught by his
genial air and by his “logic”; there is nothing
morose about the treatises, and even to-day they
are readable, though not quite in the way that the
author intended.</p>

<p class='c012'>A solemn assembly of Greeks, held in honour of a dead serpent,
was gathering at Pytho, and Eunomus sang a funeral ode for the
reptile. Whether his song was a hymn in praise of the snake or
a lamentation over it, I cannot say; but there was a competition
and Eunomus was playing the lyre in the heat of the day, at the
time when the grasshoppers, warmed by the sun, were singing under
the leaves along the hills. They were singing, you see, not to the
dead serpent of Pytho, but to the all-wise God, a spontaneous song,
better than the measured strains of Eunomus. A string breaks in
the Locrian’s hands; the grasshopper settles upon the neck of the
lyre and begins to twitter there as if upon a branch: whereupon
the minstrel, by adapting his music to the grasshopper’s lay, supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the place of the missing string. So it was not Eunomus that drew
the grasshopper by his song, as the legend would have it, when it
set up the bronze figure at Pytho, showing Eunomus with his lyre
and his ally in the contest. No, the grasshopper flew of its own
accord, and sang of its own accord, although the Greeks thought it
to have been responsive to music.</p>

<p class='c013'>How in the world is it that you have given credence to worthless
legends, imagining....</p>
<p class='c011'>and blasts of theology ensue. But how grateful
one is to Clement for mentioning the grasshopper,
and how probable it seems, from the way he tells
the story, that he had a faint consciousness of its
beauty—just as his risqué passages emanate a
furtive consciousness of their riskiness. His learning
is immense: he is said to allude to three
hundred Greek writers of whom we should not
otherwise have heard, and one gladly follows him
through the back-yards of the Classical world.
The results of his ramble are most fully stated in
two other of his treatises, the “Rug roll” and the
“Tutor.” His verdict is that, though the poetry
of Hellas is false and its cults absurd or vile, yet
its philosophers and grasshoppers possessed a
certain measure of divine truth; some of the speculations
of Plato, for instance, had been inspired by
the Psalms. It is not much of a verdict in the
light of modern research; but it is a moderate
verdict for a Father; he spares his thunders, he
does not exalt asceticism, he is never anti-social.</p>
<p class='c012'>Till the ground if you are a husbandman; but recognize God
in your husbandry. Sail the sea, you who love sea-faring; but
ever call upon the heavenly pilot. Were you a soldier on campaign
when the knowledge of God laid hold of you? Then listen to
the commander who signals righteousness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here he shows his respect for the existing fabric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and his hope that it may pass without catastrophe
from Pagan to Christian, a hope that could have
found expression only at Alexandria, where contending
assertions have so often been harmonized,
and whose own god, Serapis, had expressed the
union of Egypt and Greece.</p>

<p class='c005'>Looking back—it is so easy now to look back!—one
can see that the hope was vain. Christianity,
though she contained little that was fresh doctrinally,
yet descended with a double-edged sword that
hacked the ancient world to pieces. For she had
declared war against two great forces—Sex and the
State—and during her complicated contest with
them the old order was bound to disappear. The
contest had not really begun in Clement’s day.
Sex disquieted him, but he did not revolt against
it like his successor Origen. The State exiled him,
but it had not yet put forth, as it did under
Diocletian, its full claims to divinity. He lived in
a period of transition, and in Alexandria. And
in that curious city, which had never been young
and hoped never to grow old, conciliation must
have seemed more possible than elsewhere, and the
graciousness of Greece not quite incompatible with
the Grace of God.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>ST. ATHANASIUS</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c003'>I</h3>
<p class='c011'>That afternoon was one of comparative calm for
the infant Church. She was three hundred and
ten years old. The pagan persecutions had ceased,
and disputes about the Nature of Christ, over which
blood was more freely to flow, had not yet matured.
It still seemed that under her inspired guidance
the old world would pass without disaster into
the new. What lovely weather! The month was
June, and the beacon of smoke that rose from the
summit of the Pharos was inclined over Alexandria
by a northerly wind. Both harbours were filled
with ships; the Eastern Harbour was lined with
palaces. The Western Harbour—and to it we
must turn—was indeed less splendid. Then, as
now, it washed the business quarter, the warehouses,
the slums where the dock hands lived. Hardness
and poverty edged it as they do to-day, and
Christianity had settled here early, as she settled
on all spots where the antique civilization had
failed to make men dignified. Issuing out of the
Gate of the Moon, the great Canopic Way here
lost its straightness and split into ignoble lanes.
There was only one redeeming feature—a house
in which a real bishop was sitting. His name was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Alexander. He has invited some clergymen to
lunch, and they are late.</p>
<p class='c005'>Bishops existed then in a profusion we can
scarcely conceive. Every large village produced
one, and they even went so far as to disorganize
the postal service by galloping about in troops
upon the government horses. But he of Alexandria
was a bishop of no ordinary brand. He bore the
title of “Patriarch of all the Preaching of St.
Mark,” and a prestige that only Rome challenged.
If he lived in these slums, it was because historical
associations detained him. The sainted shoemaker
Annianus had plied his trade hard by. A church
to the right—St. Theonas’—had been built by
another local saint. Here were the origins of his
power, but its field lay elsewhere—eastward among
the splendours of the town; southward, hundreds
of miles southward, up the valley of the Nile.
The whole of Egypt was ripe for Christianity. A
magnificent prize!</p>

<p class='c005'>The waters of the harbour, placid and slightly
stale, came almost up to his house. He gazed at
them, and at the grubby beach where some little
boys were playing. They were playing at going
to church. They were poor, they had no toys,
and, since railway trains did not exist, going to
church was the only game they could command.
Indeed, it is a fascinating game. Even Anglican
nurseries have succumbed to it. Scantily robed,
they processed and inclined, and the Bishop, being
not Anglican, but African, only smiled. Boys will
be boys! He was specially diverted by their
leader, a skinny but sportive youth, who would
take his flock for a swim and, diving, reappear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>when and where they least expected. Then more
solemn thoughts returned.</p>

<p class='c005'>The whole of Egypt was ripe for Christianity.
Ah, but for what kind of Christianity? That was
the trouble. Fancy if, with Arius, it adopted the
heresy of “Time was when He was not”! Fancy
if it paltered with Gnosticism, and believed that
creation, with its palaces and slums, is the result
of a muddle! Fancy if it Judaized with Meletius,
the disobedient Bishop of Assiout! Alexander
had written to Meletius, asking him to Judaize less,
but had had no reply. That was the disadvantage
of a copious episcopy. You could never be sure
that all the bishops would do the same thing.
And there were dreadful examples in which flighty
laymen had lost their heads, and, exclaiming, “Me
be bishop too!” had run away into the desert
before any one could stop them. The Emperor
Constantine (that lion-hearted warrior!) was a
further anxiety. Constantine so easily got mixed.
Immersed in his town-planning, he might stamp
some heresy as official and then the provinces
would take it up. How difficult everything was!
What was to be done? Perhaps the clergymen,
when they arrived for lunch, would know. There
used to be too little Christianity. Now there
almost seemed too much. Alexander sighed, and
looked over the harbour to the Temple of Neptune
that stood on the promontory. He was growing
old. Where was his successor?—someone who
... not exactly saintliness and scholarship, but
someone who would codify, would define?</p>

<p class='c005'>Stop! stop! Boys will be boys, but there are
limits. They were playing at Baptism now, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the sportive youth was in the act of pouring some
of the harbour water over two other Gippoes.
To enter into the Bishop’s alarm we must remember
the difference between Northern and Southern conceptions
of impiety. To the Northerner impiety is
bad taste. To the Southerner it is magic—the
illicit and accurate performance of certain acts,
and especially of sacramental acts. If the youth
had made any mistake in his baptismal ritual it
would not have mattered, it would have remained
play. But he was performing accurately what he
had no right to perform; he was saying, “Me be
bishop too,” and Heaven alone knew the theological
consequences. “Stop! stop!” the genuine article
cried. It was too late. The water fell, the trick
was done ... and at the same moment the
clergymen arrived, offering such apologies for their
unpunctuality as are usual among Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was long before lunch was served. The
culprits were summoned, and in terrific conclave
their conduct was discussed. There was some
hope that the two converts were Christians already,
in which case nothing would have been affected.
But no. They had bowed the knee to Neptune
hitherto. Then were they Christians now? Or
were they horrid little demons who, outside or
inside the Church, would harm her equally? The
sportive youth prevailed. He won over the Bishop,
and calmed the clergymen’s fears, and before
evening fell and the smoke on the Pharos turned
to a column of fire, it was settled that he had by his
play rendered two souls eligible for immortal bliss.
And his action had a more immediate consequence:
he never washed again. Taken into the Bishop’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>house, he became his pupil, his deacon, his coadjutor,
his successor in the see, and finally a saint and a
doctor of the Church: he is St. Athanasius.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>II</h3>

<p class='c014'>At the other end of the city there lived another
clergyman. His name was Arius, and it was a
very long time indeed since the Bishop had asked
him to lunch. He took duty at St. Mark’s, a small
church that stood on the brink of the Mediterranean.
The neighbourhood was of the best—palaces,
zoological gardens, lecture-rooms, etc.—and over
some trees rose the long back of the temple that
Cleopatra had built to Antony. That temple would
make a seemly cathedral, Arius often thought, and
the obelisks in its forecourt—Cleopatra’s Needles—would
be improved if they supported statues
of God the Father. The whole of Egypt was
ripe for Christianity—for the right kind of
Christianity, that is to say: not for the kind that
was preached at the western end of the town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arius was elderly by now. Learned and sincere,
tall, simple in his dress, persuasive in his manner,
he was accused by his enemies of looking like a
snake and of seducing, in the theological sense,
seven hundred virgins. The accusation amazed
him. He had only preached what is obviously
true. Since Christ is the Son of God, it follows
that Christ is younger than God, and that there
must have been a condition—no doubt before time
began—when the first Person of the Trinity
existed, and the Second did not. This has only
to be stated to be believed, and only those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>were entirely possessed by the devil, like doddering
Alexander and slippery Athanasius, would state the
contrary. The Emperor Constantine (that lion-hearted
warrior!) would certainly see the point,
provided it was explained to him. But Constantine
so easily got mixed, and there was indeed a danger
that he would stamp the wrong type of Christianity
as official, and plunge the world into heresy for
thousands of years. How difficult everything was!
One’s immediate duty was to testify, so day after
day Arius preached Arianism to the seven hundred
virgins, to the corpse of the Evangelist St. Mark
who lay buried beneath the church, and to the
bright blue waves of the sea that in their ceaseless
advance have now covered the whole scene.</p>

<p class='c005'>The quarrel between him and his bishop grew
so fierce and spread so far that Constantine was
obliged to intervene and to beg his fellow-Christians
to imitate the Greek philosophers, who could
differ without shedding one another’s blood. It
was just the sort of appeal that everyone had been
fearing that the Emperor would make. He was
insufficiently alive to eternal truth. No one obeyed,
and in desperation he summoned them to meet him
at Nicæa on the Black Sea, and spent the interval
in trying to find out what their quarrel turned
on. Two hundred and fifty bishops attended,
many priests, deacons innumerable. Among the
last named was Athanasius, who, thundering against
Arius in full conclave, procured his overthrow.
Amid scenes of incredible violence the Nicene
Creed was passed, containing clauses (since omitted)
in which Arianism was anathematized. Arius was
banished. Athanasius led his tottering but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>triumphant bishop back to Alexandria, and the
Emperor returned to the town-planning and to the
wardrobes of wigs and false hair that sometimes
solace the maturity of a military man.</p>

<p class='c005'>The powers of Athanasius were remarkable.
Like Arius, he knew what truth is, but, being a
politician, he knew how truth can best be enforced;
his career blends subtlety with vigour, self-abnegation
with craft. Physically he was blackish, but
active and strong. One recognizes a modern street
type. Not one single generous action by him is
recorded, but he knew how to inspire enthusiasm,
and before he died had become a popular hero and
set the pace to his century. Soon after his return
from Nicæa he was made Patriarch of Alexandria,
but he had scarcely sat down before Arius was
back there too. The Emperor wished it. Could
not Christians imitate, etc...? No; Christians
could not and would not; and Athanasius testified
with such vigour that he was banished in his turn,
and his dusty theological Odyssey begins. He was
banished in all five times. Sometimes he hid in
a cistern, or in pious ladies’ houses, or in the
recesses of the Libyan desert; at other times, going
farther afield, he popped up in Palestine or France.
Roused by his passage from older visions, the soul
of the world began to stir, and to what activity!
Heavy Romans, dreamy Orientals and quick Greeks
all turned to theology, and scrambled for the
machinery of the Pagan State, wrenching this way
and that until their common heritage was smashed.
Cleopatra’s temple to Antony first felt the killing
glare of truth. Arians and Orthodox competed
for its consecration, and in the space of six years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>its back was broken and its ribs cracked by fire.
St. Theonas’—the episcopal church—was gutted,
and Athanasius nearly killed by some soldiers on
its altar. And all the time everyone was writing—encyclicals
as to the date of Easter, animadversions
against washing, accusations of sorcery, complaints
that Athanasius had broken a chalice in a church
in a village near Lake Mariout, replies that there
was no chalice to break, because there was no
church, because there was no village—reams and
reams of paper on this subject travelling over the
empire for years, and being perused by bishops in
Mesopotamia and Spain. Constantine died; but his
successors, whatever their faith, were drawn into
the dance of theology, none more so than Julian,
who dreamed of Olympus. Arius died, falling
down in the streets of Alexandria one evening while
he was talking to a friend; but Arianism survived.
Athanasius died too; but not before he had weaned
the Church from her traditions of scholarship and
tolerance, the tradition of Clement and Origen.
Few divines have done more for her, and her
gratitude has been both profound and characteristic;
she has coupled his name to a Creed with
which he had nothing to do—the Athanasian.</p>

<p class='c005'>Were his activities all about nothing? No!
The Arian controversy enshrined a real emotion.
By declaring that Christ was younger than God
Arius tended to make him lower than God, and
consequently to bring him nearer to man—indeed,
to level him into a mere good man and to forestall
Unitarianism. This appealed to the untheologically-minded—to
Emperors, and particularly to
Empresses. It made them feel less lonely. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Athanasius, who viewed the innovation with an
expert eye, saw that while it popularized Christ it
isolated God, and raised man no nearer to heaven
in the long run. Therefore he fought it. Of the
theatre of this ancient strife no trace remains in
Alexandria. Not even Cleopatra’s Needle stands
there now. But the strife still continues in the
heart of men, ever prone to substitute the human
for the divine, and it is probable that many an
individual Christian to-day is an Arian without
knowing it.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>TIMOTHY THE CAT<br /> AND TIMOTHY WHITEBONNET</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Miaou!”</p>
<p class='c005'>Such was the terrible sound which, half way
through the fifth century, disturbed the slumbers
of certain Monophysite monks. Their flesh crept.
Moved by a common impulse, each stole from his
cell, and saw, in the dimly lighted corridor, a
figure even more mysterious than pussy’s—something
that gibbered and bowed and said, in hollow
and sepulchral tones, “Consecrate Timothy.” They
stood motionless until the figure disappeared, then
ran this way and that in search of it. There was
nothing to be seen. They opened the convent
doors. Nothing to be seen except Alexandria
glimmering, still entirely marble; nothing except
the Pharos, still working and sending out from the
height of five hundred feet a beam visible over a
radius of seventy miles. The streets were quiet,
owing to the absence of the Greek garrison in
Upper Egypt. Having looked at the tedious
prospect, the monks withdrew, for much had to be
done before morning: they had to decide whether
it was an angel or a devil who had said “Miaou.”
If the former, they must do penance for their lack
of faith; if the latter, they were in danger of
hell-fire. While they argued over a point that has
puzzled the sharpest of saints, the attention of some
of them began to wander, and to dwell on one
who was beyond doubt a devil—Proterius, whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the Emperor had imposed on them as their Patriarch,
and who slept in a convent hard by. They
cursed Proterius. They reflected too that in the
absence of the garrison he no longer slept safely,
that they were Egyptians and numerous, he a Greek
and alone. They cursed him again, and the apparition
reappeared repeating, “Consecrate Timothy.”
Timothy was one of their own number and the
holiest of men. When, after an interval, they ran
to his cell, they found him upon his knees in prayer.
They told him of the ghostly message, and he
seemed dazed, but on collecting himself implored
that it might never be mentioned again. Asked
whether it was infernal, he refused to reply. Asked
whether it was supernal, he replied, “You, not I,
have said so.” All doubts disappeared, and away
they ran to find some bishops. Melchite or Arian
or Sabæan or Nestorian or Donatist or Manichæan
bishops would not do: they must be Monophysite.
Fortunately two had occurred, and on the following
day Timothy, struggling piously, was carried
between Cleopatra’s Needles into the cathedral
and consecrated Patriarch of Alexandria and of all
the Preaching of St. Mark. For he held the correct
opinion as to the Nature of Christ—the only
possible opinion: Christ has a single Nature,
divine, which has absorbed the human: how could
it be otherwise? The leading residential officials,
the municipal authorities, and the business community
thought the same; so, attacking Proterius,
who thought the contrary, they murdered him in
the Baptistery, and hanged him over the city wall.
The Greek garrison hurried back, but it was too
late. Proterius had gone, nor did the soldiers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>regret him, for he had made more work than most
bishops, having passed the seven years of his
episcopate in a constant state of siege. Timothy,
for whom no guards need be set, was a great
improvement. Diffident and colloquial, he won
everyone’s heart, and obtained, for some reason or
other, the surname of the Cat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the <i>coup d’église</i> had succeeded for the
moment. But it had to reckon with another monk,
a second Timothy, of whom, as events proved, the
angel had really been thinking. He was Timothy
Whitebonnet, so called from his headgear, and his
life was more notable than the Cat’s, for he lived
at Canopus, where the air is so thick with demons
that only the most robust of Christians can breathe.
Canopus stood on a promontory ten miles east of
Alexandria, overlooking the exit of the Nile. Foul
influences had haunted it from the first. Helen,
a thousand years ago, had come here with Paris
on their flight towards Troy, and though the local
authorities had expelled her for vagabondage, the
ship that carried her might still be seen, upon
summer nights, ploughing the waves into fire. In
her train had followed Herodotus, asking idle
questions of idle men; Alexander, called the Great
from his enormous horns; and Serapis, a devil
worse than any, who, liking the situation, had
summoned his wife and child and established them
on a cliff to the north, within sound of the sea.
The child never spoke. The wife wore the moon.
In their honour the Alexandrians used to come
out along the canal in barges and punts, crowned
with flowers, robed in gold, and singing spells of
such potency that the words remained, though the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>singers were dead, and would slide into Timothy
Whitebonnet’s ear, when the air seemed stillest,
and pretend to him that they came from God.
Often, just as a sentence was completed, he would
realize its origin, and have to expectorate it in the
form of a toad—a dangerous exercise, but it taught
him discernment, and fitted him to play his part
in the world. He learned with horror of the riots
in the metropolis, and of the elevation of the
heretical Cat. For he knew that Christ has two
Natures, one human, the other divine: how can
it be otherwise?</p>

<p class='c005'>At Constantinople there seems to have been
a little doubt. Leo, the reigning emperor, was
anxious not to drive Egypt into revolt, and disposed
to let Alexandria follow the faith she preferred.
But his theologians took a higher line, and insisted
on his sending a new garrison. This was done,
the Cat was captured, and Whitebonnet dragged
from Canopus and consecrated in his place. There
matters rested until the accession of Basiliscus, who
sent a new garrison to expel Whitebonnet. Once
more the Cat ruled bloodily until the Emperor
Zeno took the other view, and sending a——</p>

<p class='c005'>However, the curtain may drop now. The
controversy blazed for two hundred years, and is
smouldering yet. The Copts still believe, with
Timothy the Cat, in the single Nature of Christ;
the double Nature, upheld by Timothy Whitebonnet,
is still maintained by the rest of Christendom
and by the reader. The Pharos, the Temple of
Serapis—these have perished, being only stones,
and sharing the impermanence of material things.
It is ideas that live.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>ELIZA IN EGYPT</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c003'>I</h3>
<p class='c011'>When the lively and somewhat spiteful Mrs. Eliza
Fay landed at Alexandria in the summer of 1779
that city was at her lowest ebb. The glories of
the antique had gone, the comforts of the modern
had not arrived. Gone were the temples and
statues, gone the palace of Cleopatra and the
library of Callimachus, the Pharos had fallen and
been succeeded by the feeble Pharillon, the Heptastadion
had silted up; while the successors to
these—the hotels, the clubs, the drainage system,
the exquisite Municipal buildings—still slept in the
unastonished womb of time.</p>
<p class='c005'>Attached to Mrs. Fay was her husband, an
incompetent advocate, who was to make their
fortunes in the East. Since the boat that had
brought them was owned by a Christian, they were
forbidden to enter the Western Harbour, and had
to disembark not far from the place where, in more
enlightened days, the Ramleh Tramway was to
terminate. All was barbarism then, save for two
great obelisks, one prone, one erect—“Cleopatra’s
Needles,” not yet transferred to New York and
London respectively. They were met in this
lonely spot by the Prussian Consul, a certain Mr.
Brandy, who found them rooms, but had bad news
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>for them: “a melancholy story,” as Mrs. Fay calls
it when writing to her sister. Between Cairo and
Suez, on the very route they proposed to take, a
caravan had been held up and some of its passengers
murdered. She was pitiably agitated. But she
did not give up her sight-seeing; she had got to
Alexandria and meant to enjoy it. Cleopatra’s
Needles in the first place. What did the hieroglyphics
on them signify? She applied to Mr.
Brandy; but the Consul, following the best
traditions of the residential Levant, “seemed to
know no more than ourselves.” His kindness was
unfailing. Next day he produced donkeys—being
Christians they were not allowed to ride horses—and
the party trotted over three miles of desert
to Pompey’s Pillar, preceded by a janissary with
a drawn sword. Pompey’s Pillar arouses few
emotions in the modern breast. The environs are
squalid, the turnstile depressing, and one knows
that it dates not from Pompey but from Diocletian.
Mrs. Fay approached it in a nobler mood.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although quite unadorned, the proportions are so exquisite
that it must strike every beholder with a kind of awe, which
softens into melancholy when one reflects that the renowned hero,
whose name it bears, was treacherously murdered on this very
coast by the boatmen who were conveying him to Alexandria.
His wretched wife stood on the vessel he had just left, watching
his departure, as we may very naturally suppose, with inexpressible
anxiety. What must have been her agonies at the dreadful event!</p>

<p class='c014'>The time was to come when Mrs. Fay herself
would have watched with very little anxiety the
murder of Mr. Fay. Her Anthony—for such was
his name—led her from mess to mess, and in the
end she had to divorce him. Let us turn from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>these serious themes to a “ludicrous accident”
that befell Mr. Brandy on the way to “Cleopatra’s
Palace.” He was very large and stout, and his
donkey, seizing its opportunity, stole away from
under the consular seat and left him astride on the
sand! As for “Cleopatra’s Palace,” it was not the
genuine palace, but it was as genuine as the emotion
it inspired.</p>

<p class='c012'>Never do I remember being so affected by a like object. I
stood in the midst of the ruins, meditating on the awful scene, till
I could have almost fancied I beheld its former mistress, revelling
in luxury with her infatuated lover, Mark Anthony, who for her
sake lost all.</p>

<p class='c014'>An account of a party at the Brandies’ concludes
the letter—a clear-cut malicious account. Eliza is
the child of her century, which affected lofty
emotions but whose real interest lay in little things,
and in satire.</p>

<p class='c012'>We were most graciously received by Mrs. Brandy, who is a
native of this place; but as she could speak a little Italian we
managed to carry on something like a conversation. She was
most curiously bedizened on the occasion, and being short, dark-complexioned,
and of a complete dumpling shape, appeared
altogether the strangest lump of finery I ever beheld. She had a
handkerchief bound round her head, covered with strings composed
of spangles, but very large, intermixed with pearls and
emeralds; her neck and bosom were ornamented in the same way.
Add to all this an embroidered girdle with a pair of gold clasps,
I think very nearly four inches square, enormous ear-rings, and a
large diamond sprig at the top of her forehead, and you must allow
that she was a most brilliant figure. They have a sweet little girl
about seven years of age, who was decked out in much the same
style; but she really looked pretty in spite of her incongruous
finery. On the whole, though, I was pleased with both mother
and child; their looks and behaviour were kind, and to a stranger
in a strange land (and this is literally so to us) a little attention is
soothing and consolatory; especially when one feels surrounded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>hostilities, which every European must do here. Compared with
the uncouth beings who govern this country, I felt at home among
the natives of France, and I will even say of Italy.</p>

<p class='c013'>On taking leave, our host presented a book containing certificates
of his great politeness and attentions towards travellers, which
were signed by many persons of consideration, and at the same
time requesting that Mr. Fay and myself would add our names to
the list. We complied, though not without surprise that a gentleman
in his situation should have recourse to such an expedient,
which cannot but degrade him in the eyes of his guests.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rather cattish, that last remark, considering how
much the Consul had done for her. But a cat she
is—spirited and observant, but a cat.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>II</h3>

<p class='c014'>Heedless of the weather, heedless of the rumour
of plundered caravans, Eliza removed her husband
as soon as possible for the interior, and some
account must now be given of their adventures.
Her pen is our guide. Through flood and blood
it keeps its way, curbed only by her fear of the
Turkish Censor, and by her desire to conceal her
forebodings from friends at home. As soon as
misfortunes have occurred she will describe them.
But about the future she is always confident and
bright, and this gallant determination to make the
best of trouble gives charm to a character that is
otherwise unsympathetic.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Fays selected the river route. Since the
Mahmoudieh Canal had not been cut, they had to
reach the Rosetta mouth of the Nile by sea. They
were nearly drowned crossing its bar, and scarcely
were they through when a boat of thieves shot
out from the bank and caused Mr. Fay to fire off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>two pistols at once. They outsailed their pursuers,
and sped up the lower reach to Rosetta, then a more
important place than Alexandria and apparently a
tidier place. Eliza was delighted. Thoughts of
England and of the English Bible at once welled
up in her mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is an appearance of cleanliness in Rosetta, the more
gratifying because seldom met with in any degree so as to remind us
of what we are accustomed to at home. The landscape around
was interesting from its novelty, and became peculiarly so on considering
it as the country where the children of Israel sojourned.
The beautiful, I may say the unparalleled story of Joseph and his
brethren rose to my mind as I surveyed these banks on which the
Patriarch sought shelter for his old age, where his self-convicted
sons bowed down before their younger brother, and I almost felt as
if in a dream, so wonderful appeared the circumstance of my being
here.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is news that Jacob ever resided in the province
of Behera. Passing by this, and by the Pyramids
which they only saw from a distance, we accompany
the Fays to Boulac, “the port of Grand Cairo,”
where their troubles increased. Restrictions against
Christians being even severer here than at Alexandria,
Mrs. Fay had to dress as a native before
she might enter the city. “I had in the first place
a pair of trousers with yellow leather half-boots
and slippers over them”; then a long satin gown,
another gown with short sleeves, a robe of silk
like a surplice, muslin from her forehead to her
feet, and over everything a piece of black silk.
“Thus equipped, stumbling at every step, I sallied
forth, and with great difficulty got across my noble
beast; but as the veil prevented me breathing
freely I must have died by the way.” She rode
into the European enclave where terror and confusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>greeted her. The rumour about the caravan
proved only too true. Complete details had just
arrived. It had been plundered between Cairo
and Suez, its passengers had been killed or left
to die in the sun, and, worse still, the Turkish
authorities were so upset by the scandal that they
proposed murdering the whole of the European
community in case the news leaked out. It was
thought that Mrs. Fay might be safe with an Italian
doctor. As she waddled across to his house her
veil slipped down so that a passer reprimanded her
severely for indecency. Also she fell ill.</p>

<p class='c012'>There broke out a severe epidemical disease with violent
symptoms. People are attacked at a moment’s warning with
dreadful pains in stiff limbs, a burning fever with delirium and a
total stoppage of perspiration. During two days it increases, on
the third there comes on uniformly a profuse sweat (pardon the
expression) with vomiting which carries all off.</p>

<p class='c014'>But as soon as her disease culminated, out she
sallied to see the ceremonies connected with the rise
of the Nile. They disappointed and disgusted her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not a decent person could I distinguish among the whole
group. So much for this grand exhibition, which we have
abundant cause to wish had not taken place, for the vapours arising
from such a mass of impurity have rendered the heat more intolerable
than ever. My bedchamber overlooks the canal, so that I
enjoy the full benefit to be derived from its proximity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Events by now were taking a calmer turn. Mr.
Fay, who had also had the epidemic, was restored
to such vitality as he possessed, and the Turkish
authorities had been persuaded by a bribe of £3000
to overcome their sensitiveness and to leave the
European colony alive. The terrible journey
remained, but beyond it lay India and perhaps a
fortune.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h3 class='c003'>III</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Suez caravan—an immense affair—was
formed up in the outskirts of Cairo. In view of
the recent murders it included a large guard, and
the journey, which took three days, passed off
without disaster. Mr. Fay had a horse; Eliza,
still panting in her Oriental robes, travelled in a
litter insecurely hung between two restive camels.
Peeping out through its blinds she could see the
sun and the rocks by day, and the stars by night.
She notes their beauty, her senses seem sharpened
by danger, and she was to look back on the desert
with a hint of romance. Above her head, attached
to the roof of the litter, were water-bottles, melons,
and hard-boiled eggs, her provision for the road,
rumbling and crashing together to the grave disturbance
of her sleep. “Once I was saluted by
a parcel of hard eggs breaking loose from their
net and pelting me completely. It was fortunate
that they were boiled, or I should have been in
a pretty trim.” By her side rode her husband,
and near him was a melancholy figure, followed
by a sick greyhound, young Mr. Taylor, who
became so depressed by the heat that he slid off
his horse and asked to be allowed to die. His
request was refused, as was his request that she
should receive the greyhound into her litter.
Eliza was ever sensible. She was not going to
be immured with a boiling hot dog which might
bite her. “I hope no person will accuse me of
inhumanity for refusing to receive an animal in
that condition: self-preservation forbade my compliance;
I felt that it would be weakness instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of compassion to subject myself to such a risk.”
Consequently the greyhound died. An Arab
despatched him with his scimitar, Mr. Taylor
protested, the Arab ran at Mr. Taylor. “You
may judge from this incident what wretches we
were cast among.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They found a boat at Suez and went on board at
once. Mr. Fay writes a line to his father-in-law to tell
him that they are safe thus far: a grandiose little line:</p>

<p class='c012'>Some are now very ill, but I stood it as well as any Arabian in
the caravan, which consisted of at least five thousand people. My
wife insists on taking the pen out of my hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>She takes it, to the following effect:</p>

<p class='c012'>My dear Friends—I have not a moment’s time, for the boat
is waiting, therefore can only beg that you will unite with me in
praising our Heavenly Protector for our escape from the various
dangers of our journey. I never could have thought my constitution
was so strong. I bore the fatigues of the desert like a lion.
We have been pillaged of almost everything by the Arabs. This
is the Paradise of thieves, I think the whole population may be
divided into two classes of them: those who adopt force and those
who effect their purpose by fraud.... I have not another moment.
God bless you! Pray for me, my beloved friends.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not clear when the Fays had been pillaged,
or of what; perhaps they had merely suffered the
losses incidental to an Oriental embarkation. The
ship herself had been pillaged, and badly. She had
been connected with the earlier caravan—the ill-fated
one—and the Government had gutted her in
its vague embarrassment. Not a chair, not a table
was left. Still they were thankful to be on board.
Their cabin was good, the captain appeared good-natured
and polite, and their fellow-passengers, a
Mr. and Mrs. Tulloch, a Mr. Hare, a Mr. Fuller,
and a Mr. Manesty, seemed, together with poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Mr. Taylor from the caravan, to promise inoffensive
companionship down the Red Sea. Calm was the
prospect. But Eliza is Eliza. And we have not
yet seen Eliza in close contact with another lady.
Nor have we yet seen Mrs. Tulloch.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>IV</h3>

<p class='c014'>The beauty of the Gulf of Suez—and surely it is
most beautiful—has never received full appreciation
from the traveller. He is in too much of a hurry
to arrive or to depart, his eyes are too ardently
bent on England or on India for him to enjoy
that exquisite corridor of tinted mountains and
radiant water. He is too much occupied with his
own thoughts to realize that here, here and nowhere
else, is the vestibule between the Levant and the
Tropics. Nor was it otherwise in the case of Mrs.
Fay. As she sailed southward with her husband
in the pleasant autumn weather, her thoughts dwelt
on the past with irritation, on the future with hope,
but on the scenery scarcely at all. What with the
boredom of Alexandria, what with her fright at
Cairo, what with the native dress that fanaticism
had compelled her to wear (“a terrible fashion for
one like me to whom fresh air seems the greatest
requisite for existence”), and finally what with
Suez, which she found “a miserable place little
better than the desert which it bounds,” she quitted
Egypt without one tender word. Even her Biblical
reminiscences take an embittered turn. She forgets
how glad Jacob had been to come there and only
remembers how anxious Moses and Aaron had been
to get away.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Content to have escaped, she turns her gaze
within—not of course to her own interior (she is no
morbid analyst) but to the interior of the boat, and
surveys with merciless eyes her fellow-passengers.
The letter that describes them exhibits her talent,
her vitality, and her trust in Providence, and incidentally
explains why she never became popular,
and why “two parties,” as she terms them, were
at once formed on board, the one party consisting
of her husband and herself, the other of everyone
else. The feud, trivial at the time, was not to be
without serious consequences. “You will now
expect me, my dear friends,” she begins, “to say
something of those with whom we are cooped up,
but my account will not be very satisfactory, though
sufficiently interesting to us—to being there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The grammar is hazy. But the style makes all
clear.</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman Mrs. Tulloch, of whom I entertained some
suspicion from the first, is, now I am credibly informed, one of the
very lowest creatures taken off the streets in London. She is so
perfectly depraved in disposition that her supreme delight consists
in making everybody about her miserable. It would be doing her
too much honour to stain my paper with a detail of the various
artifices she daily practises to that end. Her pretended husband,
having been in India before and giving himself many airs, is looked
upon as a person of mighty consequence whom no one chooses to
offend. Therefore madam has full scope to exercise her mischievous
talents, wherein he never controls her, not but that he perfectly
understands to make himself feared. Coercive measures are sometimes
resorted to. It is a common expression of the lady, “Lord
bless you, if I did such or such a thing, Tulloch would make no
more ado, but knock me down like an ox.” I frequently amuse
myself with examining their countenances, where ill-nature has
fixed her empire so firmly that I scarcely believe either of them
smiled except maliciously.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for the captain he is a mere Jack in office. Being unexpectedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>raised to that post from second mate by the death of
poor Captain Vanderfield and his chief officer on the fatal Desert,
he has become from this circumstance so insolent and overbearing
that everyone detests him. Instead of being ready to accommodate
every person with the few necessaries left by the plundering Arabs,
he constantly appropriates them to himself. “Where is the
captain’s silver spoon? God bless my soul, Sir, you have got my
chair; must you be seated before the captain’s glass?” and a great
deal more of this same kind; but this may serve as a specimen.
And although the wretch half starves us, he frequently makes
comparisons between his table and that of an Indiaman which we
dare not contradict while in his power.</p>

<p class='c014'>Food is a solemn subject. Eliza was not a
fastidious or an insular eater and she would gladly
sample the dishes of foreign climes. But she did
demand that those dishes should be plentiful, and
that they should nourish her, and loud are her
complaints when they do not, and vigorous the
measures she takes.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the first fortnight of our voyage my foolish complaisance
stood in my way at table, but I soon learned our gentle
maxim, catch as catch can. The longest arm fared best, and you
cannot imagine what a good scrambler I have become. A dish
once seized, it is my care to make use of my good fortune; and
now provisions running very short, we are grown quite savages:
two or three of us perhaps fighting for a bone, for there is no respect
of persons. The wretch of a captain, wanting our passage money
for nothing, refused to lay in a sufficient quantity of stock; and if
we do not soon reach our port, what must be the consequence,
Heaven knows.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Hare, Eliza’s chief gentleman enemy, was
not dangerous at meals. It was rather the activity
of his mind that threatened her. Whenever she
writes of him, her pen is at its sharpest, it is indeed
not so much a pen as a fang. It lacerates his social
pretentiousness, his snobbery, the scorbutic blotches
on his face, and his little white eyes. Poor young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Mr. Taylor once showed him a handsome silver-hilted
sword. He admired it, till he saw on the
scabbard the damning inscription, “Royal Exchange.”
“Take your sword,” said he; “it’s surprising a
man of your sense should commit an error; for
fifty guineas I would not have a city name on
any article of my dress.” She comments: “Now
would anyone suppose this fine gentleman’s father
was in trade and he himself brought up in that very
city he affects to despise? Very true, nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>How, by the way, did she know that? Who
told her? And, by the way, how did she know
about Mrs. Tulloch? But one must not ask such
dreadful questions. They shatter the foundations
of faith.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so his studied attention to me in the minutest article
effectually shielded him from suspicion till his end was answered,
of raising up a party against us, by the means of that vile woman,
who was anxious to triumph over me, especially as I have been
repeatedly compelled (for the honour of the sex) to censure her
swearing and indecent behaviour. I have, therefore, little comfort
to look forward to for the remainder of the voyage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then she reckons up her allies, or rather the
neutrals. They are a feeble set.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is only justice to name Mr. Taylor as an amiable though
melancholy companion, and Mr. Manesty, an agreeable young man
under twenty. Mr. Fuller is a middle-aged man. He has, it
seems, fallen into the hands of sharpers and been completely
pillaged. He has the finest dark eyes I ever met with. Mr.
Moreau, a musician, is very civil and attentive.</p>

<p class='c014'>Small fry like these could be no help. They
can scarcely have got enough to eat at dinner.
Her truer supports lay within.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having early discovered the confederacy, prudence determined
us to go mildly on, seemingly blind to what it was beyond our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>power to remedy. Never intermeddling with their disputes, all
endeavours to draw us into quarrels are vainly exerted. I despise
them too much to be angry.</p>

<p class='c014'>And the letter concludes with a moving picture
of home life in the Red Sea:</p>

<p class='c012'>After meals I generally retire to my cabin, where I find plenty
of employment, having made up a dozen shirts for Mr. Fay out of
some cloth I purchased to replace part of those stolen by the Arabs.
Sometimes I read French or Italian and study Portuguese. I likewise
prevailed on Mr. Fay to teach me shorthand, in consequence
of the airs Mr. Hare gave himself because he was master of this
art and had taught his sisters to correspond with him in it. The
matter was very easily accomplished. In short, I have discovered
abundant methods of making my time pass usefully and not disagreeably.
How often, since in this situation, have I blessed God
that He has been pleased to endow me with a mind capable of
furnishing its own amusement, despite of all means used to discompose
it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Admirable too is the tone of the postscript:</p>

<p class='c012'>I am in tolerable health and looking with a longing eye towards
Bengal, from whence I trust my next will be dated. The climate
seems likely to agree very well with me. I do not at all mind the
heat, nor does it at all affect either my spirits or my appetite.—Your
ever affectionate E. F.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was to date her next not from Bengal but
from prison. Here, however, her Alexandrian
audience must really have the decency to retire.
Eliza in chains is too terrible a theme. Let it
suffice to say that though in chains she remained
Eliza, and that Mrs. Tulloch was enchained too;
and let those who would know more procure
“The Original Letters from India of Mrs. Eliza
Fay,” published by the Calcutta Historical Society.
The book contains a portrait of our heroine, which
quite fills the cup of joy. She stands before us in
the Oriental robes she detested so much, but she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>has thrown back their superfluities and gazes at
the world as though seeing through its little tricks.
One trousered foot is advanced, one bangled arm
is bent into an attitude of dignified defiance. Her
expression, though triumphant, is alert. She is
attended in the background by a maid-servant and
a mosque.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>COTTON FROM THE OUTSIDE</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c003'>I</h3>
<p class='c011'>“Oh, Heaven help us! What is that dreadful
noise! Run, run! Has somebody been killed?”</p>
<p class='c005'>“Do not distress yourself, kind-hearted sir. It
is only the merchants of Alexandria, buying cotton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But they are murdering one another surely.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not so. They merely gesticulate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does any place exist whence one could view
their gestures in safety?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is such a place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall come to no bodily harm there?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“None, none.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then conduct me, pray.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And mounting to an upper chamber we looked
down into a stupendous Hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is usual to compare such visions to Dante’s
Inferno, but this really did resemble it, because it
was marked out into the concentric circles of which
the Florentine speaks. Divided from each other
by ornamental balustrades, they increased in torment
as they decreased in size, so that the inmost ring
was congested beyond redemption with perspiring
souls. They shouted and waved and spat at each
other across the central basin which was empty
but for a permanent official who sat there, fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>in ice. Now and then he rang a little bell, and
now and then another official, who dwelt upon a
ladder far away, climbed and wrote upon a board
with chalk. The merchants hit their heads and
howled. A terrible calm ensued. Something worse
was coming. While it gathered we spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, name this place!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is none other than the Bourse. Cotton is
sold at this end, Stocks and Shares at that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And I perceived a duplicate fabric at the farther
end of the Hall, a subsidiary or rather a superseded
Hell, for its circles were deserted, it was lashed
by no everlasting wind, and such souls as loitered
against its balustrades seemed pensive in their mien.
This was the Stock Exchange—such a great name
in England, but negligible here where only cotton
counts. Cotton shirts and cotton wool and reels
of cotton would not come to us if merchants did
not suffer in Alexandria. Nay, Alexandria herself
could not have re-arisen from the waves, there
would be no French gardens, no English church
at Bulkeley, possibly not even any drains....</p>

<p class='c005'>Help! Oh, help! help! Oh, horrible, too
horrible! For the storm had broken. With the
scream of a devil in pain a stout Greek fell sideways
over the balustrade, then righted himself,
then fell again, and as he fell and rose he chanted
“Teekoty Peapot, Teekoty Peapot.” He was offering
to sell cotton. Towards him, bull-shouldered,
moved a lout in a tarboosh. Everyone else
screamed too, using odd little rhythms to advertise
their individuality. Some shouted unnoticed, others
would evoke a kindred soul, and right across the
central pool business would be transacted. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>seemed to have evolved a new sense. They communicated
by means unknown to normal men.
A wave of the note-book, and the thing was done.
And the imitation marble pillars shook, and the
ceiling that was painted to look like sculpture
trembled, and Time himself stood still in the person
of a sham-renaissance clock. And a British officer
who was watching the scene said—never mind
what he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hence, hence!</p>
<h3 class='c003'>II</h3>

<p class='c014'>My next vision is cloistral in comparison. Vision
of a quiet courtyard a mile away (Minet el Bassal),
where the cotton was sold on sample. Pieces of
fluff sailed through the sunlight and stuck to my
clothes. Their source was the backs of Arabs,
who were running noiselessly about, carrying
packages, and as they passed it seemed to be the
proper thing to stretch out one’s hand and to pull
out a tuft of cotton, to twiddle it, and to set it
sailing. I like to think that the merchant to whom
it next stuck bought it, but this is an unbridled
fancy. Let us keep to facts, such as to the small
fountain in the middle of the courtyard, which
supported a few aquatic plants, or to the genuine
Oriental carpets which were exposed for sale on
the opposite wall. They lent an air of culture,
which was very pleasing. Yet, though here there
was no cause for fear, the place was even more
mysterious than the Bourse. What did it all
mean? To the outsider nothing seems more
capricious than the mechanism of business. It
runs smoothly when he expects it to creak, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>creaks when he expects it to be still. Considering
how these same men could howl and spit, one would
have anticipated more animation over the samples.
Perhaps they sometimes showed it, but my memory
is of calm celibates in dust-coats who stood idling
in the sunshine before the doors of their cells,
sipping coffee and exchanging anecdotes of a somewhat
mechanical impropriety. Very good the
coffee was, too, and the very blue sky and the keen
air and the bright dresses of some natives raised
for a moment the illusion that this courtyard was
actually the academic East, and that caravans of
camels were waiting with their snowy bales outside.
There were other courtyards with ramifications of
passages and offices, where the same mixture of
light business and light refreshments seemed in
progress—architectural backwaters such as one
used to come across in the Earl’s Court Exhibition,
where commerce and pleasure met in a slack communion.
These I did not care for, but the main
courtyard was really rather jolly, and that British
officer (had he visited it) could certainly have left
his comment (whatever it was) unspoken.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hence!</p>
<h3 class='c003'>III</h3>

<p class='c014'>In the final stage I was in the thick of it again,
though in a very different sort of thickness. Cotton
was everywhere. The flakes of Minet el Bassal
had become a snowstorm, which hurtled through
the air and lay upon the ground in drifts. The
cotton was being pressed into bales, and perhaps
being cleaned too—it is shocking not to be sure,
but the row was tremendous. The noise was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>made no longer by merchants—who seldom so far
remount the sources of their wealth—but by a
certain amount of wooden machinery and by a
great many Arabs. Some of them were fighting
with masses of the stuff which was poured over
them from an endless staircase. Just as they
mastered it, more would arrive and completely
bury them. They would shout with laughter and
struggle, and then more cotton would come and
more, quivering from the impetus of its transit, so
that one could not tell which was vegetable, which
man. They thrust it into a pit in the flooring,
upon which other Arabs danced. This was the
first stage in the pressing—exerted by the human
foot with the assistance of song. The chant rose
and fell. It was better than the chants of the
Bourse, being generic not personal, and of immemorial
age—older than Hell at all events.
When the Arabs had trodden the cotton tight, up
they jumped, and one of them struck the flooring
with his hand. The bottom of the pit opened
in response, a sack was drawn across by invisible
agents, and the mass sank out of sight into a lower
room, where the final pressure was exerted on it
by machinery. We went down to see this and to
hear the “cri du coton,” which it gives when it
can shrink no more. Metal binders were clamped
round it and secured by hand, and then the completed
bale—as hard as iron and containing two
or three Arabs inside it for all I know—was tumbled
away to the warehouse.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is difficult to speak intelligently about or
against machinery, and my comments made no
great stir—<i>e.g.</i> “Why has it to be pressed?” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Do the different people’s cotton not get mixed?”
and “What I like is, it is so primitive.” To this
last indeed it was somewhat severely replied that
the process I had viewed was anything but primitive—nay,
that it was the last word on cotton-pressing,
or it would not have been adopted at Alexandria.
This was conclusive, and one can only hope that
it will be the last word for ever, and that for century
after century brown legs and rhythmic songs
will greet the advancing cataracts of snow. That
peevish British officer would have forgotten his
peevishness had he come here. He would have
regretted his criticism of the Bourse. It was “A
bomb in the middle of them is the only possible
comment,” and when he made it I realized that
there was someone in the world even more outside
cotton than I was myself.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>THE DEN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>At last I have been to a Den. The attempt was
first made many years ago in Lahore City, where
my guide was a young Missionary, who wasted
all his time in liking people and making them like
him. I have often wondered what he found to
convert, and what his financial backers—old ladies
in America and England—will have to say upon
the results of his labours. He had lived in the
Lahore bazaars as a poor man, and as he walked
through their intricacies he explained how this
became comprehensible, and that pardonable, and
that inevitable, so soon as one drew close enough
to it to understand. We did interesting things—went
into a temple as big as a cupboard where we
were allowed to hold the gods and ring the bells,
visited a lawyer who was defending a client against
the charge of selling a wife—and as the afternoon
closed the Missionary said he supposed I should
like to include a Den. He remarked that a great
deal of rubbish was talked about opium, and he led
me to a courtyard, round whose sides were some
lean-to’s of straw. “Oh! it isn’t working,” he
said with disappointment. He peered about and
pulled from a lean-to a solitary sinner. “Look at
his eyes,” he said. “I’m afraid that’s all.”</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>There my acquaintance with Vice stopped, until
Egypt, the land of so much, promised new opportunities.
It would not be opium here, but hashish,
a more lurid drug. Concealed in walking-sticks,
it gave delicious dreams. So I was glad of a chance
of accompanying the police of Alexandria upon
a raid. Their moral tone was superior to the
Missionary’s, but they had no better luck. Advancing
stealthily upon a fragile door they burst it open
and we rushed in. We were in a passage, open to
the stars. Right and left of it, and communicating
with one another, were sheds which the police
explored with their heavy shoulders and large feet.
In one of them they found a tired white horse.
A corporal climbed into the manger. “They often
secrete bowls here,” he said. At the end of the
passage we came upon human life. A family was
asleep by the light of a lamp—not suspiciously
asleep, but reasonably disturbed by our irruption.
The civil father was ordered to arise and carry the
lamp about, and by its light we found a hollow
reed, at which the police sniffed heavily. Traces
of hashish adhered to it, they pronounced. That
was all. They were delighted with the find, for
it confirmed their official faith—that the city they
controlled was almost pure but not quite. Too
much or too little would have discredited them.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few weeks later an Egyptian friend offered
to take me round the native quarters of the same
town. We did interesting things—saw a circumcision
procession, listened to an epic recitation—and
as the evening closed he asked me whether
I should like to include a Den. He thought he
knew of one. Having laid his hand on his forehead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>for a moment he led through intricate streets
to a door. We opened it silently and slipped in.
There was something familiar in the passage, and
my forebodings were confirmed by the sight of a
white horse. I had left as an avenging angel, I was
to return as a devotee. I knew better than my
friend that we should find no hashish—not even
the hollow reed, for it had been confiscated as an
exhibit to the Police Station—but I said nothing,
and in due time we disturbed the sleeping family.
They were uncivil and refused to move their lamp.
My friend was disappointed. For my own part
I could hardly help being sorry for poor sin. In
all the vast city was this her one retreat?</p>

<p class='c005'>But outside he had an idea. He thought he
knew of another Den, which was less exposed to
the onslaughts of purity since it was owned by a
British subject. We would go there. And we
found the genuine article at last. It was up a
flight of stairs, down which the odour (not a disagreeable
one) floated. The proprietor—a one-eyed Maltese—battled
with us at the top. He
hadn’t hashish, he cried, he didn’t know what
hashish was, he hardly knew what a room was or
a house. But we got in and saw the company.
There is really nothing to say when one comes to
the point. They were just smoking. And at the
present moment they don’t even smoke, for my
one and only Den has been suppressed by the
police—just as his old ladies must by now have
suppressed my Missionary at Lahore.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE MOON</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Of the three streets that dispute the honour of
being Alexandria’s premier thoroughfare the Rue
Rosette undoubtedly bears the palm for gentility.
The Bond Street (I refer to Rue Chérif Pacha) is
too shoppy to be genteel, and the Boulevard de
Ramleh competes from this particular aspect not
at all. In its length, its cleanliness, and the refined
monotony of its architecture, Rue Rosette outdoes
either of its rivals. They are tainted with utility:
people use them to get something or somewhere.
But Rue Rosette is an end in itself. It starts in
the middle of the town and no man can tell where
it stops: a goal it may have, but not one discoverable
by mortal leg. Its horizon, narrow but
uninterrupted, ever unrolls into a ribbon of blue
sky above the wayfarer’s head, and the ribbon of
white beneath his feet corresponds, and right and
left of him are the houses that he thought he had
passed a quarter of an hour before. Oh, it is so
dull! Its dullness is really indescribable. What
seem at first to be incidents—such as the trays of
worthies who project from the clubs—prove at
a second glance to be subdued to what they sit
in. They are half asleep. For you cannot have
gentility without paying for it.</p>
<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>The poor street does not want to be dull. It
wants to be smart, and of a Parisian smartness.
Eternally well-dressed people driving infinitely in
either direction—that is its ideal. It is not mine,
and we meet as seldom as possible in consequence.
But friends of a higher social outlook tell me that,
by a great effort, they can feel perfectly at home
in the Rue Rosette—can transform the municipal
buildings into Ministries, and the Consulates into
Embassies, and arabias into broughams, can increase
the polish on the gentlemen’s boots and the frou-frou
from the ladies’ skirts, until the Rue Rosette
becomes what it yearns to be—a masterpiece by
Baron Haussmann, debouching in an Arc de
Triomphe instead of a Police Station.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have never been able to make that effort.
When fancies do come here, they are of an older
and friendlier civilization. I recall Achilles Tatius,
a bishop of the post-classical period, who wrote
a somewhat improper novel. He made his hero
enter Alexandria by this very street one thousand
years ago. It was not called the Rue Rosette then,
but the Canopic Road, and it was not genteel or
smart but presented throughout its length scenes
of extraordinary splendour. Beginning at the Gate
of the Sun (by the Public Gardens) it traversed
the city uninterruptedly until it reached the waters
of the Harbour (near Minet el Bassal), and here
stood the Gate of the Moon, to close what the
Sun had begun. The street was lined with marble
colonnades from end to end, as was the Rue Nebi
Daniel, and the point of their intersection (where
one now stands in hopeless expectation of a tram)
was one of the most glorious crossways of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>ancient world. Clitophon (it was thus that the
Bishop named his hero) paused there in his walk,
and looked down the four vistas, over whose ranks
rose temples and palaces and tombs, and he tells
us that the crossways bore the name of Alexander,
and that the Mausoleum close to them was Alexander’s
tomb. He does not tell us more, being
in search of a female companion named Leucippe,
whom he deems of more permanent interest, but
there is no reason to doubt his statements, for
Achilles Tatius himself lived here and dare not
cause his characters to lie. The passage gleams
like a jewel among the amorous rubbish that
surrounds it. The vanished glory leaps up again,
not in architectural detail but as a city of the soul.
There (beneath the Mosque of Nebi Daniel) is the
body of Alexander the Great. There he lies,
lapped in gold and laid in a coffin of glass. When
Clitophon made his visit he had already lain there
for eight hundred years, and according to legend
he lies there still, walled into a forgotten cellar.
And of this glory all that tangibly remains is a
road: the alignment of the Rue Rosette. Christian
and Arab destroyed the rest, but they could not
destroy the direction of a road. Towards the
harbour they did divert it, certainly; the great
thoroughfare contracts into the Rue Sidi Metwalli
and becomes heaven knows what in the neighbourhood
of the Rue des Sœurs. But in its eastern
stretch it runs with its old decision, and the limestone
and stucco still throw over it the shadows
that marble once threw.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of the two gates there survives not even a
description. They may have been masterpieces of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>art, they may have been simple entrances, but they
must certainly have included shrines to the god
and goddess who respectively guarded them. No
one took much notice of the shrines. Paganism,
even in the days of Clitophon and Leucippe, was
dead. It is dead, yet the twin luminaries still reign
over the street and give it what it has of beauty.
In the evening the western vista can blaze with
orange and scarlet, and the eastern, having darkened,
can shimmer with a mysterious radiance, out of
which, incredibly large, rises the globe of the moon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>THE SOLITARY PLACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Delicate yet august, the country that stretches
westward from the expiring waters of Lake Mariout
is not easy to describe. Though it contains accredited
Oriental ingredients, such as camels, a
mirage, and Bedouins, and though it remounts to
a high antiquity, yet I cannot imagine our powerful
professional novelists getting to work at it, and
extracting from its quiet recesses hot tales about
mummies and sin. Its basis is a soft limestone,
which rises on the seaward side into two well-defined
and parallel ridges, and swells inland into
gentle hills whose outlines and colouring often
suggest a Scotch moor: the whole district has a
marked tendency to go purple, especially in its
hollows—into that sombre brownish purple that
may be caused by moorland growths. Many of
the bushes are like flowerless heather. In the
lower ground barley is cultivated, and depends for
its success upon an occasional violent thunderstorm
which shall swill a sudden torrent off the hills.
The ancients cultivated vines and olives here too,
as the remains of their presses prove, and Cleopatra
had a garden here, but from such luxuries the soil
has desisted. It has beat a general retreat from
civilization, and the spirit of the place, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>being savage, is singularly austere. Its chief
episode is the great temple of Abousir, which with
its attendant beacon-tower stands so magnificently
upon the coastal ridge. And inland lie the marble
basilicas of St. Menas and his holy well. But these
apart, there is nothing to catch the attention. The
tents of the Bedouins, so Mongolian in outline,
seldom cut the lines of the sky, but blend in colour
with the stone, against which they crouch. The
quarries, vast and romantic, lie hidden in the flanks
of the limestone. They do not play the part that
a chalk-pit does in the landscape of the Sussex
downs. The place is not a wilderness, it is a
working concern. But it is essentially solitary,
and only once a year does it, for a brief space, put
its solitude away, and blossom.</p>
<p class='c005'>There is nothing there of the ordered progress
of the English spring, with its slow extension
from wood-anemones through primroses into the
buttercups of June. The flowers come all of a
rush. One week there is nothing but spikes and
buds, then the temperature rises or the wind drops,
and whole tracts turn lilac or scarlet. They scarcely
wait for their leaves, they are in such a hurry, and
many of them blossom like little footstools, close
to the ground. They do not keep their times.
They scarcely keep their places, and you may look
in vain for them this season where you found them
last. There is a certain tract of yellow marigolds
that I suspect of migration. One year it was in
a quarry, the next by the railway line, now it has
flown a distance of five and a half miles and unfolded
its carpet on the slopes beneath Abousir. All is
confusion and hurry. The white tassels of garlic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>that wave in the shadow of the temple may be
fallen to-morrow, the blue buds of the borage never
have time to unfold. The pageant passes like the
waving of a handkerchief, but in compensation
without the lumber that attends the passing of an
English spring, no stalks and reluctant exits of
half-dead leaves. As it came, so it goes. It has
been more like a ray of coloured light playing on
the earth than the work of the earth herself, and
if one had not picked a few of the flowers and
entombed them in vases upon an Alexandrian
mantelpiece, they could seem afterwards like the
growths of a dream.</p>

<p class='c005'>It would require a botanist to do justice to these
flowers, but fortunately there is no occasion to do
justice to flowers. They are not Government
officials. Let their titles and duties remain for
the most part unknown. The most permanent of
them are, oddly enough, the asphodels, whose
coarse stems and turbid venous blossoms have
disappointed many who dreamt of the Elysian
Fields. How came the Greeks to plant so buxom
a bulb in the solitary place they imagined beyond
the grave—that place which though full of
philosophers and charioteers remains for ever
empty? The asphodel is built to resist rough
winds and to stand on the slopes of an earthly hill.
It is too heavy for the hands of ghosts, too harsh
for their feet, but perhaps ours were not the
asphodels the Greeks planted, and their ghosts may
have walked upon what we call Stars of Bethlehem.
The marigolds are solid too, but for the most part
the flora are very delicate, and their colours aerial.
There is a tiny vetch that hesitates between terracotta
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and claret. There is a scented yellow flower
the size of flax which is only found in one part of
the district and which closes in the evening when
the irises unfold. Two of these irises are dwarf,
and coloured purple and deep blue; at third is
larger and china blue. There are tracts of night-scented
stock. Down in the quarries grows a rock
plant with a dull red spire and a fleshy leaf that
almost adheres to the stone. As for the shrubs,
some have transparent joints that look filled with
wine; while from the woolly fibre of others jut
buttons like a blue scabious. Other blue plants
wave their heads in the barley. Mignonette, purple
and white anemones, scarlet and yellow ranunculus,
scarlet poppies, coltsfoot and dwarf orange marigolds,
nettles genuine and false, henbane, mallows,
celandine, hen and chickens, lords and ladies,
convolvulus. English daisies I do not remember.
And many of these flowers are not the varieties
we know in England. The lords and ladies, for
instance, are smaller and thrust up their pale green
spoons in the open ground. While, to compensate,
there is a larger kind—an arum of great size with
a coal-black sheath and clapper—a positively
Satanic plant, such as Des Esseintes would have
commanded for his conservatory. In this way,
just here and there, the tropic note is struck, and
reminds us that these familiar and semi-familiar
flowers are after all growing in Africa, and that
those swelling hills stretch southwards towards the
heart of the dark continent.</p>

<p class='c005'>But what impresses one most in the scene is
the quiet persistence of the earth. There is so
little soil about and she does so much with it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Year after year she has given this extraordinary
show to a few Bedouins, has covered the Mareotic
civilization with dust and raised flowers from its
shards. Will she do the same to our own tins
and barbed wire? Probably not, for man has now
got so far ahead of other forms of life that he will
scarcely permit the flowers to grow over his works
again. His old tins will be buried under new tins.
This is the triumph of civilization, I suppose, the
final imprint of the human upon this devoted
planet, which should exhibit in its apotheosis a
solid crust of machinery and graves. In cities
one sees this development coming, but in solitary
places, however austere, the primæval softness
persists, the vegetation still flowers and seeds
unchecked, and the air still blows untainted hot
from the land or cold from the sea. I have tried
to describe this Mariout country as it is at the
beginning of March, when the earth makes her
great effort. In a few days the wind may scratch
and tear the blossoms, in a few weeks the sun will
scorch the leaves. The spongeous red growth of
the ice-plant endures longest and further empurples
the hills. This too will dry up and the bones of
the limestone reappear. Then all will be quiet till
the first winter rain, when the camels will be driven
out to surface-plough. A rectangle is outlined on
the soil and scattered with seed barley. Then the
camel will shuffle up and down dragging after him
a wooden plough that looks like a half-open
penknife, and the Bedouin, guiding it, will sing
tunes to the camel that he can only sing to the
camel, because in his mind the tune and the camel
are the same thing.</p>

  <h2 id='cavafy' class='c006'>THE POETRY OF C. P. CAVAFY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Modern Alexandria is scarcely a city of the soul.
Founded upon cotton with the concurrence of
onions and eggs, ill built, ill planned, ill drained—many
hard things can be said against it, and most
are said by its inhabitants. Yet to some of them,
as they traverse the streets, a delightful experience
can occur. They hear their own name proclaimed
in firm yet meditative accents—accents that seem
not so much to expect an answer as to pay homage
to the fact of individuality. They turn and see a
Greek gentleman in a straw hat, standing absolutely
motionless at a slight angle to the universe. His
arms are extended, possibly. “Oh, Cavafy...!”
Yes, it is Mr. Cavafy, and he is going either from
his flat to the office, or from his office to the flat.
If the former, he vanishes when seen, with a slight
gesture of despair. If the latter, he may be prevailed
upon to begin a sentence—an immense complicated
yet shapely sentence, full of parentheses
that never get mixed and of reservations that really
do reserve; a sentence that moves with logic to its
foreseen end, yet to an end that is always more
vivid and thrilling than one foresaw. Sometimes
the sentence is finished in the street, sometimes the
traffic murders it, sometimes it lasts into the flat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>It deals with the tricky behaviour of the Emperor
Alexius Comnenus in 1096, or with olives, their
possibilities and price, or with the fortunes of
friends, or George Eliot, or the dialects of the
interior of Asia Minor. It is delivered with equal
ease in Greek, English, or French. And despite
its intellectual richness and human outlook, despite
the matured charity of its judgments, one feels
that it too stands at a slight angle to the universe:
it is the sentence of a poet.</p>
<p class='c005'>A Greek who wishes to compose poetry has a
special problem; between his written and spoken
language yawns a gulf. There is an artificial
“literary” jargon beloved by schoolmasters and
journalists, which has tried to revive the classical
tradition, and which only succeeds in being dull.
And there is the speech of the people, varying from
place to place, and everywhere stuffed with non-Hellenic
constructions and words. Can this speech
be used for poetry and for cultivated prose? The
younger generation believes that it can. A society
(Nea Zoe) was started in Alexandria to encourage
it, and shocks the stodgy not only by its writings
but by its vocabulary—expressions are used that
one might actually hear in a shop. Similar movements
are born and die all over the Levant, from
Smyrna and Cyprus to Jannina, all testifying to
the zeal of a race who, alone among the peoples of
the Eastern Mediterranean, appear to possess the
literary sense and to desire that words should be
alive. Cavafy is one of the heroes of this movement,
though not one of its extremists. Eclectic
by nature, he sees that a new theory might be as
sterile as the old, and that the final test must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the incommunicable one of taste. His own poems
are in Demotic, but in moderate Demotic.</p>

<p class='c005'>They are all short poems, and unrhymed, so
that there is some hope of conveying them in a
verbal translation. They reveal a beautiful and
curious world. It comes into being through the
world of experience, but it is not experience, for
the poet is even more incapable than most people
of seeing straight:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here let me stand. Let me too look at Nature a little,</div>
      <div class='line'>the radiant blue of the morning sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>the cloudless sky and the yellow beach;</div>
      <div class='line'>all beautiful and flooded with light.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here let me stand. And let me deceive myself into thinking that I saw them—</div>
      <div class='line'>(I really did see them one moment, when first I came)</div>
      <div class='line'>—that I am not seeing, even here, my fancies,</div>
      <div class='line'>my memories, my visions of voluptuousness.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is the world within. And since the poet cannot
hope to escape from this world, he should at all
costs arrange and rule it sensibly. “My mind to
me a kingdom is,” sang the Elizabethan, and so
is Cavafy’s; but his is a real, not a conventional,
kingdom, in which there may be mutinies and war.
In “The City” he sketches the tragedy of one
who misgoverned, and who hopes to leave the
chaos behind him and to “build another city,
better than this.” Useless!</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The city shall ever follow you.</div>
      <div class='line'>In these same streets you shall wander,</div>
      <div class='line'>and in the same purlieux you shall roam,</div>
      <div class='line'>and in the same house you shall grow grey....</div>
      <div class='line'>There is no ship to take you to other lands, there is no road.</div>
      <div class='line'>You have so shattered your life here, in this small corner,</div>
      <div class='line'>that in all the world you have ruined it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>And in “Ithaca” he sketches another and a nobler
tragedy—that of a man who seeks loftily, and finds
at the end that the goal has not been worth the
effort. Such a man should not lament. He has
not failed really.</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ithaca gave you your fair voyage.</div>
      <div class='line'>Without her you would not have ventured on the way,</div>
      <div class='line'>but she has no more to give you.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And if you find Ithaca a poor place, she has not mocked you.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You have become so wise, so full of experience,</div>
      <div class='line'>that you should understand by now what these Ithacas mean.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The above extracts illustrate one of Cavafy’s
moods—intensely subjective; scenery, cities and
legends all re-emerge in terms of the mind. There
is another mood in which he stands apart from his
subject-matter, and with the detachment of an
artist hammers it into shape. The historian comes
to the front now, and it is interesting to note how
different is his history from an Englishman’s. He
even looks back upon a different Greece. Athens
and Sparta, so drubbed into us at school, are to
him two quarrelsome little slave states, ephemeral
beside the Hellenistic kingdoms that followed them,
just as these are ephemeral beside the secular
empire of Constantinople. He reacts against the
tyranny of Classicism—Pericles and Aspasia and
Themistocles and all those bores. Alexandria, his
birthplace, came into being just when Public School
Greece decayed; kings, emperors, patriarchs have
trodden the ground between his office and his
flat; his literary ancestor—if he has one—is
Callimachus, and his poems bear such titles as
“The Displeasure of the Seleucid,” “In the Month
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of Athyr,” “Manuel Comnenus,” and are prefaced
by quotations from Philostratus or Lucian.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two of these poems shall be quoted in full, to
illustrate his method.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> In the first he adopts the
precise, almost mincing style of a chronicle to
build up his effect. It is called “Alexandrian
Kings” and deals with an episode of the reign of
Cleopatra and Antony.</p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f2'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A third is on page <a href='#TheGod'>56</a>.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An Alexandrian crowd collected</div>
      <div class='line'>to see the sons of Cleopatra,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cæsarion and his little brothers</div>
      <div class='line'>Alexander and Ptolemy, who for the first</div>
      <div class='line'>time were brought to the Gymnasium,</div>
      <div class='line'>there to be crowned as kings</div>
      <div class='line'>amidst a splendid display of troops.</div>

      <div class='line'>Ptolemy they named king</div>

      <div class='line'>Cæsarion stood a little in front,</div>
      <div class='line'>clad in silk the colour of roses,</div>
      <div class='line'>with a bunch of hyacinths at his breast.</div>
      <div class='line'>His belt was a double line of sapphires and amethysts,</div>
      <div class='line'>his sandals were bound with white ribbons</div>
      <div class='line'>embroidered with rosy pearls.</div>
      <div class='line'>Him they acclaimed more than the small ones.</div>
      <div class='line'>Him they named “King of Kings!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Alexandrians knew perfectly well</div>
      <div class='line'>that all this was words and empty pomp.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But the day was warm and exquisite,</div>
      <div class='line'>the sky clear and blue,</div>
      <div class='line'>the Gymnasium of Alexandria a triumph of art,</div>
      <div class='line'>the courtiers’ apparel magnificent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cæsarion full of grace and beauty</div>
      <div class='line'>(son of Cleopatra, blood of the Lagidæ!),</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and the Alexandrians ran to see the show</div>
      <div class='line'>and grew enthusiastic, and applauded</div>
      <div class='line'>in Greek, in Egyptian, and some in Hebrew,</div>
      <div class='line'>bewitched with the beautiful spectacle,</div>
      <div class='line'>though they knew perfectly well how worthless,</div>
      <div class='line'>what empty words, were these king-makings.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Such a poem has, even in a translation, a “distinguished”
air. It is the work of an artist who is
not interested in facile beauty. In the second
example, though its subject-matter is pathetic,
Cavafy stands equally aloof. The poem is broken
into half-lines; he is spelling out an epitaph on
a young man who died in the month of Athyr,
the ancient Egyptian November, and he would
convey the obscurity, the poignancy, that sometimes
arise together out of the past, entwined into
a single ghost:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It is hard to read ... on the ancient stone.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Lord Jesus Christ” ... I make out the word “Soul.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“In the month of Athyr ... Lucius fell asleep.”</div>
      <div class='line'>His age is mentioned ... “He lived years....”—</div>
      <div class='line'>The letters KZ show ... that he fell asleep young.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the damaged part I see the words ... “Him ... Alexandrian.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then come three lines ... much mutilated.</div>
      <div class='line'>But I can read a few words ... perhaps “our tears” and “sorrows.”</div>
      <div class='line'>And again: “Tears” ... and: “for us his friends mourning.”</div>
      <div class='line'>I think Lucius ... was much beloved.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the month of Athyr ... Lucius fell asleep....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Such a writer can never be popular. He flies
both too slowly and too high. Whether subjective
or objective, he is equally remote from the bustle
of the moment, he will never compose either a
Royalist or a Venizelist Hymn. He has the strength
(and of course the limitations) of the recluse, who,
though not afraid of the world, always stands at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>a slight angle to it, and, in conversation, he has
sometimes devoted a sentence to this subject.
Which is better—the world or seclusion? Cavafy,
who has tried both, can’t say. But so much is
certain—either life entails courage, or it ceases to
be life.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>A serious history of Alexandria has yet to be
written, and perhaps the foregoing sketches may
have indicated how varied, how impressive, such
a history might be. After the fashion of a pageant
it might marshal the activities of two thousand
two hundred and fifty years. But unlike a pageant
it would have to conclude dully. Alas! The
modern city calls for no enthusiastic comment.
Its material prosperity seems assured, but little
progress can be discerned elsewhere, while as for
the past such links as remain are being wantonly
snapped: for instance, the Municipality has altered
the name of the Rue Rosette to the meaningless
Rue Fouad Premier, and has destroyed a charming
covered Bazaar near the Rue de France, and out
at Canopus the British Army of Occupation has
done its bit by breaking up the Ptolemaic ruins to
make roads. Everything passes, or almost everything.
Only the climate, only the north wind and
the sea remain as they were when Menelaus, the
first visitor, landed upon Ras el Tin, and exacted
from Proteus the promise of life everlasting. He
was to escape death, on his wife’s account: he
was not to descend into the asphodel with the
other shades whom Hermes conducts, himself a
shade. Immortal, yet somehow or other unsatisfactory,
Menelaus accordingly leads the Alexandrian
pageant with solid tread; cotton-brokers conclude
it; the intermediate space is thronged with
phantoms, noiseless, insubstantial, innumerable, but
not without interest for the historian.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
